# Security Monitoring

24/7 security operations, threat detection, and continuous monitoring to protect your whistleblowing platform and sensitive data.

## Overview

Security monitoring is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your whistleblowing platform. Disclosurely operates a comprehensive security monitoring program that combines automated threat detection, human security analysts, and advanced anomaly detection to identify and respond to security incidents before they impact your organization or compromise reporter confidentiality.

Our security monitoring infrastructure operates 24/7/365, continuously analyzing system logs, user behavior patterns, network traffic, and application events to detect suspicious activity. This proactive approach ensures rapid incident detection and response while maintaining compliance with ISO 27001, SOC 2, and regulatory requirements for security oversight.

Learn more about our comprehensive security approach in the [Security Overview](/security/overview) documentation.

## Threat Detection and Prevention

### Automated Threat Detection

Disclosurely employs multiple layers of automated threat detection:

**Authentication Threats:**
- Multiple failed login attempts from single account
- Brute force password guessing patterns
- Credential stuffing attacks using compromised credentials
- Account takeover attempts with unusual login locations
- Session hijacking or session fixation attempts
- Concurrent sessions from impossible geographic locations

**Access Control Violations:**
- Users attempting to access unassigned cases
- Excessive case viewing or data downloads
- Access attempts outside normal working hours
- Permission escalation attempts
- Unauthorized identity access for confidential reports
- Suspicious case search patterns

**Data Exfiltration Attempts:**
- Bulk download of case files or evidence
- Automated scraping or API abuse
- Data access from unfamiliar IP addresses or locations
- Unusual data transfer volumes
- Screenshots or printing of sensitive documents
- Attempts to bypass encryption or access controls

**Application Security Threats:**
- SQL injection attempts in forms or API calls
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack attempts
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attempts
- File upload of malicious content
- API rate limiting violations
- Unusual user agent strings indicating bots

### Behavioral Analytics

Advanced user behavior analytics detect insider threats and compromised accounts:

**Normal Behavior Baselines:**
- Typical login times and locations for each user
- Standard case access patterns based on role
- Regular communication patterns with reporters
- Usual evidence download frequency
- Expected session durations
- Normal navigation patterns within application

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Access outside normal working hours
- Login from unfamiliar locations or devices
- Sudden spike in case viewing activity
- Access to cases outside assigned categories
- Unusual messaging frequency or patterns
- Deviation from typical user workflows

**Risk Scoring:**
- Automatic risk score assignment to user sessions
- Elevated monitoring for high-risk activities
- Adaptive authentication requiring additional verification
- Automatic session termination for critical anomalies
- Investigation triggers for sustained suspicious behavior

## Security Alerting

### Real-Time Alerts

Critical security events trigger immediate alerts to relevant stakeholders:

**Alert Types:**

**Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):**
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Unauthorized access to reporter identity data
- Bulk data exfiltration detected
- System compromise indicators
- Database integrity violations
- Encryption key access attempts

**High Priority Alerts (Response Within 1 Hour):**
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns detected
- Permission violations
- Suspicious case access
- Account lockouts triggered
- Malware or virus detection

**Medium Priority Alerts (Response Within 24 Hours):**
- Access review exceptions
- Configuration changes requiring approval
- Unusual user behavior patterns
- Minor policy violations
- Security patch availability
- Certificate expiration warnings

### Alert Distribution

Alerts are distributed through multiple channels for reliability:

- Real-time dashboard notifications for administrators
- Email alerts to security team and administrators
- SMS notifications for critical security events
- Integration with incident management platforms
- Webhook notifications to external monitoring systems
- Mobile app push notifications (Enterprise plan)

Configure alert preferences in your [Organization Settings](/admin/organization-settings).
