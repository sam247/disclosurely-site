# Session Management

Protect sensitive whistleblowing data with intelligent session management that detects and prevents unauthorized access through multi-session awareness and device tracking.

## What is Session Management?

Session Management in Disclosurely is a security feature that monitors and controls user login sessions. The system enforces a **one active session per user** policy, automatically detecting when you log in from multiple devices and prompting you to choose which session to continue.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-Session Detection**: Automatically detects simultaneous logins
- **Device Tracking**: Identifies device type, browser, and operating system
- **Location Monitoring**: Shows approximate location of login attempts
- **Session Control**: Choose which device to continue on
- **Security Alerts**: Visual warnings when suspicious activity detected
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes inactive sessions automatically

## Why One Session Per User?

**Security Benefits**:
- **Prevents Account Sharing**: One person per account
- **Detects Unauthorized Access**: Alerts you if someone else logs in
- **Reduces Breach Risk**: Limits exposure if credentials are compromised
- **Compliance**: Meets audit requirements for access control
- **Accountability**: Clear attribution of actions to individuals
- **Data Protection**: Minimizes risk of sensitive case data exposure

**Use Cases**:
- Detect if your account is compromised
- Prevent password sharing among team members
- Identify suspicious login locations
- Enforce single-user policy
- Maintain audit trail integrity

## How It Works

### Login Process

**Step 1: You Log In**
- Enter your credentials on any device
- System authenticates your identity
- New session created

**Step 2: Session Tracking**
- System records your device information
- Browser and OS detected automatically
- Approximate location determined (IP-based)
- Session ID generated and stored

**Step 3: Multi-Session Detection**
- System checks for other active sessions
- If another session exists, alert triggered
- Modal dialog appears with session details

**Step 4: Choose Action**
- **Continue on this device**: Terminates other session
- **Continue on other device**: Logs out current device
- **Log out everywhere**: Terminates all sessions

### Device & Location Tracking

**Information Collected**:

**Device Information**:
- Device type: Desktop, Tablet, or Mobile
- Device name: Brand/model when available
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android

**Location Information** (IP-based):
- City (approximate)
- Country
- Latitude/Longitude (approximate)
- Map visualization

**Privacy Note**: Location is approximate based on IP address, not precise GPS. Typical accuracy: City-level (±10-50 miles).

### Session Activity

**Activity Monitoring**:
- Last activity timestamp tracked
- Updates every 5 minutes while active
- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

**What Counts as Activity**:
- Page navigation
- Form submissions
- API requests
- Any user interaction

**What Doesn't Count**:
- Leaving browser tab open but idle
- Background processes
- Closed browser window

## Multi-Session Detection Modal

When you log in and another session is detected, you'll see:

### Modal Components

**Alert Header**:
- Security shield icon (amber/yellow)
- "Multiple Login Session Detected" title
- Informational, not alarmist tone

**Other Session Details**:
- Device icon (smartphone, tablet, or desktop)
- Device name and browser
- Operating system
- Location (city, country)
- Last activity time (e.g., "5 minutes ago")
- Interactive map showing approximate location

**Action Buttons**:
1. **"This wasn't me. Continue on this device"**
   - Dismisses the alert
   - Keeps both sessions active temporarily
   - Use if you recognize the other session

2. **"Continue on another device"**
   - Logs out the current device
   - Preserves the other session
   - Use if you want to use the other device

3. **"Log out everywhere"**
   - Terminates all sessions (current + other)
   - Forces fresh login on all devices
   - Use if you suspect unauthorized access

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: You Forgot Your Laptop Was Logged In**
```
You log in on your phone at home.
Alert shows: MacBook Pro (Chrome) in Office, 3 hours ago

Action: Click "Continue on this device"
Result: Laptop session ended, phone session continues
```

**Scenario 2: Suspicious Login Detected**
```
You log in from New York.
Alert shows: Unknown device (Firefox) in London, 2 minutes ago

Action: Click "Log out everywhere"
Result: All sessions terminated, change password immediately
```

**Scenario 3: Switching Between Work and Home**
```
You log in at home after leaving work computer on.
Alert shows: Desktop (Edge) in Chicago, 1 hour ago

Action: Click "Continue on this device"
Result: Work session ended, home session continues
```

**Scenario 4: Using Multiple Tabs**
```
You accidentally open a second tab and try to log in again.
Alert shows: Chrome on Windows in Chicago, Just now

Action: Click "This wasn't me. Continue on this device"
Result: Both tabs work normally (same device, same browser)
```

- No conflict or alert
- Session storage shared across tabs

**VPN or Proxy**:
- Location shows VPN server location
- May appear as different location

## Troubleshooting

### "Multiple Session" Alert Every Time

**Cause**: Previous session not properly terminated

**Solution**:
1. Click "Log out everywhere"
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Close all browser tabs
4. Log in again

### Location Showing Wrong City

**Cause**: IP-based geolocation is approximate

**Normal**: ±10-50 mile accuracy is expected
**If Using VPN**: Location shows VPN server city
**Corporate Network**: May show office location

**Not a Problem**: As long as country and general region are correct

### Can't Log In (Session Conflict)

**Error**: "Maximum sessions reached"

**Cause**: Bug or expired sessions not cleaned up

**Solution**:
1. Wait 30 minutes (sessions auto-expire)
2. Contact support to manually clear sessions
3. Try password reset (terminates all sessions)

### Session Expires Too Quickly

**Cause**: 30-minute idle timeout

**Solution**:
- Stay active (navigate pages periodically)
- Refresh the page before timeout
- Enterprise: Contact support for extended timeout (security review required)

### Map Not Loading

**Cause**: Browser privacy settings or ad blocker

**Solution**:
- Allow embedded content from OpenStreetMap
- Disable ad blocker on Disclosurely
- Not critical: You can still see text location
