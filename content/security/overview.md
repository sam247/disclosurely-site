# Security Overview

Comprehensive overview of Disclosurely's security architecture and practices.

## Our Security Commitment

Disclosurely is built security-first to protect whistleblowers, organizations, and sensitive investigation data. We understand that trust is earned through demonstrable security, not just promises.

**Our Principles**:
- **Privacy by design**: Security built into every feature
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: We cannot access your encrypted data
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Transparency**: Open about our security practices
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular testing and updates
- **Compliance-ready**: Meet regulatory requirements

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security

**Application Layer**:
- Secure coding practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Regular security audits

**Data Layer**:
- [AES-256 encryption at rest](/reporting/encryption)
- [End-to-end encryption for reports](/reporting/encryption)
- Zero-knowledge encryption for anonymous reports
- Encrypted database
- Encrypted backups
- Secure key management

**Network Layer**:
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- HTTPS only (HSTS enabled)
- DDoS protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Rate limiting
- Intrusion detection

**Infrastructure Layer**:
- Secure cloud hosting
- Network segmentation
- Firewall protection
- Isolated environments
- Regular security updates
- Infrastructure as code

**Physical Layer** (via cloud provider):
- SOC 2 certified data centers
- 24/7 physical security
- Biometric access controls
- Surveillance monitoring
- Redundant power and cooling
- Geographic redundancy

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

**What Is Zero-Knowledge?**

Zero-knowledge architecture means Disclosurely cannot access the content of encrypted data, even if we wanted to. This provides maximum protection for whistleblowers.

**How It Works**:

1. **Anonymous Reports**:
   - Report encrypted in browser before upload
   - Encryption key never sent to server
   - Key derived from tracking ID (only reporter has)
   - Disclosurely servers cannot decrypt
   - Only authorized organization users can decrypt

2. **Confidential Reports**:
   - Reporter identity separately encrypted
   - Multiple encryption layers
   - Role-based decryption keys
   - Investigator can read report, not identity
   - Only authorized users can access identity

3. **Evidence Files**:
   - Files encrypted before upload
   - Unique encryption key per file
   - Keys encrypted with user keys
   - Cannot be decrypted by Disclosurely
   - Organization controls decryption

**Benefits**:
- Maximum reporter protection
- Cannot be compelled to reveal content
- Breach impact minimized
- Compliance with privacy regulations
- Trust through technology

## Encryption

### Encryption Standards

**Data at Rest**:
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key length**: 256-bit
- **Implementation**: Industry-standard libraries
- **Key rotation**: Automatic periodic rotation
- **Key storage**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

**Data in Transit**:
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3
- **Cipher suites**: Strong ciphers only
- **Certificate**: Extended Validation (EV) SSL
- **HSTS**: Enabled (forces HTTPS)
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Enabled

**[End-to-End Encryption](/reporting/encryption)**:
- **Reports**: Encrypted client-side
- **Messages**: Encrypted before transmission
- **Evidence**: Encrypted before upload
- **Keys**: Never transmitted in plain text

### Encryption Key Management

**Key Hierarchy**:

1. **Master Encryption Key (MEK)**
   - Stored in HSM
   - Never exported
   - Used to encrypt Data Encryption Keys
   - Rotated annually

   - Rotated quarterly

3. **File Encryption Keys (FEKs)**
   - Per-file unique keys
   - Encrypt individual evidence files
   - Encrypted by DEK
   - Single use

4. **User Keys**
   - Per-user encryption keys
   - Control access to data
   - Derived from authentication
   - Session-specific

**Key Rotation**:
