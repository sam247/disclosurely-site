# Security Best Practices

Essential security guidelines for administrators, users, and whistleblowers to protect sensitive data and maintain platform security.

## Overview

Security is a shared responsibility between Disclosurely, your organization, and individual users. While Disclosurely provides enterprise-grade security infrastructure including encryption, access controls, and monitoring, the effectiveness of these protections depends on proper configuration, user behavior, and organizational policies. This guide provides practical, actionable security best practices for everyone involved in your whistleblowing program.

Following these best practices protects whistleblower identities, prevents unauthorized data access, maintains compliance with regulations like GDPR and the EU Whistleblowing Directive, reduces security incident risk, and builds trust in your reporting system. Security incidents can expose vulnerable whistleblowers to retaliation, create legal liability, and damage your organization's reputation—making proactive security essential.

## For Administrators

### Initial Setup and Configuration

**Secure Platform Configuration:**
- Complete [initial setup](/admin/initial-setup) with security as top priority
- Enable [multi-factor authentication](/security/mfa) requirement for all users immediately
- Configure appropriate session timeout settings (2 hours idle recommended)
- Set strong password requirements (minimum 12 characters, complexity required)
- Enable email notifications for security events
- Configure user roles following principle of least privilege
- Review default security settings and tighten as needed
- Document security configuration decisions

**User Access Management:**
- Assign minimum necessary permissions to each user role
- Use specific roles (Investigator, Reviewer) rather than making everyone Administrator
- Create separate accounts for different functions (no shared accounts)
- Implement temporary access with expiration for contractors
- Require MFA for all administrative accounts without exception
- Review and approve all user access requests formally
- Document justification for elevated access

Learn more about user management in the [Team Management](/admin/team-management) documentation.

### Ongoing Security Operations

**Regular Access Reviews:**
- Conduct quarterly access reviews for all users
- Generate access reports from dashboard
- Verify each user's role aligns with current responsibilities

- Document review findings for compliance

**Security Monitoring:**
- Review [security monitoring](/security/monitoring) dashboard daily
- Respond promptly to security alerts (same day for high priority)
- Investigate unusual access patterns even if they seem minor

- Save backup codes in secure location (password manager)
- Don't share MFA codes with anyone
- Keep backup codes separate from primary device
- Update MFA settings promptly when changing devices
- Report lost MFA device to administrator immediately

### Data Handling

**Accessing Case Information:**
- Access only cases assigned to you
- Don't attempt to access restricted or unassigned cases
- Don't share case information with unauthorized colleagues
- Follow need-to-know principle strictly
- Access sensitive cases from secure, private locations
- Don't discuss cases in public areas
- Log evidence downloads with clear business justification

**Handling Sensitive Data:**

- Follow organizational data retention policies

**Reporter Identity Protection:**
- Never attempt to identify anonymous reporters
- Access reporter identity only when authorized and necessary
- All identity access is logged and reviewed
- Don't share reporter names outside authorized channels
- Protect confidential reporter identities strictly
- Report any inadvertent identity disclosure immediately

Learn more about access controls in the [Access Control](/security/access-control) documentation.

### Threat Awareness

**Phishing and Social Engineering:**
- Be skeptical of unsolicited emails requesting credentials
- Verify sender identity before clicking links or opening attachments
- Don't click login links in emails—navigate directly to platform
- Verify URLs before entering credentials (https://disclosurely.com)
