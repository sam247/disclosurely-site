# Case Assignment

Efficiently assign and distribute cases to the right team members for investigation.

## Overview

When a new report is submitted, it needs to be assigned to an investigator or team for review. Proper case assignment ensures:

- Cases reach the right subject matter experts
- Workload is distributed evenly across your team
- Response times are minimized
- Accountability is clear from the start

## Automatic Assignment

### Rules-Based Assignment

Configure automatic assignment rules to route cases based on:

**Category-Based Routing:**
- Financial misconduct → Finance team
- HR issues → Human Resources
- Safety concerns → Health & Safety team
- Data breaches → IT Security team

**Priority-Based Routing:**
- Critical cases → Senior investigators
- Standard cases → General investigation pool
- Low priority → Junior team members

**Department-Based Routing:**
- Route cases to specific departments mentioned in report
- Cross-department issues assigned to compliance team
- Location-specific routing for multi-site organizations

### Setting Up Auto-Assignment

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Go to Dashboard > [Organization Settings](/admin/organization-settings)
   - Click "Case Assignment Rules"

2. **Create Assignment Rule**
   - Click "Add New Rule"
   - Select trigger criteria:
     - Report category
     - Priority level
     - Keywords in report
     - Department mentioned
     - Reporter location (if available)

3. **Define Assignment Target**
   - Assign to specific user
   - Assign to team/group
   - Round-robin within team
   - Load balancing based on current workload

4. **Set Rule Priority**
   - Multiple rules can match one case
   - Higher priority rules execute first
   - Set fallback assignment if no rules match

5. **Save and Activate**
   - Test rule with sample cases
   - Monitor effectiveness
   - Adjust as needed

### Round-Robin Assignment

Distribute cases evenly across team members:

**How It Works:**
1. Define pool of eligible investigators
2. System tracks who received last case
3. Next case goes to next person in rotation
4. Skips users on leave or at capacity
5. Ensures fair distribution

**Configuration:**
- Go to [Team Management](/admin/team-management)
- Create "Investigation Team" group
- Enable round-robin for group
- Set maximum concurrent cases per person
- Add/remove members as needed

### Preventing Conflicts

**System Protections:**

- Technical knowledge (IT, financial, legal)
- Investigation experience level

### Balance Workload

**Monitor:**

## Troubleshooting

### Case Not Being Auto-Assigned

**Check:**

### Cannot Re-Assign Case

**Common Causes:**
- Insufficient permissions (need Admin role)
