# Risk Assessment

AI-powered risk assessment analyzes whistleblower reports to automatically evaluate severity, predict potential impacts, and prioritize cases based on organizational risk. This intelligent system helps investigators focus on the most critical issues first while ensuring no case is overlooked.

## What is AI Risk Assessment?

Disclosurely's AI Risk Assessment engine automatically evaluates every incoming report across multiple risk dimensions, providing investigators with data-driven insights to make informed decisions about case prioritization and resource allocation.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Automated Risk Scoring**: Instant numerical risk scores (0-100) for every report
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Evaluates 20+ risk factors simultaneously
- **Severity Classification**: Categorizes cases as Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority
- **Impact Prediction**: Forecasts potential legal, financial, and reputational consequences
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Recommends investigation urgency and resource allocation
- **Continuous Re-Assessment**: Updates risk scores as new information emerges

## How AI Risk Assessment Works

### Intelligent Analysis Process

When a new report arrives, the AI Risk Assessment system:

1. **Ingests Report Data**: Analyzes report content, category, evidence, and metadata
2. **Evaluates Risk Factors**: Assesses each factor using trained AI models
3. **Calculates Risk Scores**: Generates overall and dimensional risk scores
4. **Classifies Severity**: Assigns priority level based on scoring thresholds
5. **Predicts Impact**: Forecasts potential consequences across multiple dimensions
6. **Generates Recommendations**: Suggests investigation approach and timeline
7. **Monitors Changes**: Continuously updates as investigation progresses

### Risk Scoring Factors

The AI evaluates **20+ risk factors** across five key dimensions:

**Legal Risk Factors**:
- Potential regulatory violations (GDPR, SOX, EU Directive, etc.)
- Criminal activity allegations
- Employment law issues
- Contract breaches
- Intellectual property concerns
- Litigation probability

**Financial Risk Factors**:
- Potential financial losses
- Fraud indicators
- Asset misappropriation
- Revenue impact
- Remediation costs
- Penalty exposure

**Reputational Risk Factors**:
- Public exposure potential
- Media attention likelihood
- Social media risk
- Brand damage
- Stakeholder impact
- Industry standing

**Operational Risk Factors**:
- Business disruption
- Process failures
- Safety concerns
- Supply chain impact
- Service delivery
- Employee morale

**Compliance Risk Factors**:
- Policy violations
- Code of conduct breaches
- Industry standards
- Certification requirements
- Contractual obligations
- Audit findings risk

### Severity Classification

**Risk Score Ranges**:
- **Critical (80-100)**: Immediate action required, senior leadership notification
- **High (60-79)**: Urgent investigation, assign experienced investigator
- **Medium (40-59)**: Standard timeline, routine investigation
- **Low (0-39)**: Normal priority, can be queued

**Automatic Actions by Severity**:
- **Critical**: Instant alert to compliance officer, auto-escalate to leadership
- **High**: Email notification to investigation team, 24-hour acknowledgment
- **Medium**: Assignment to available investigator, standard workflow
- **Low**: Queue for assignment, 7-day acknowledgment

## Benefits for Investigators

### Faster Triage and Prioritization

**Before AI Risk Assessment**:
- Manual review of every report to assess priority
- Subjective judgment calls
- Inconsistent prioritization
- Risk of missing critical cases
- Hours spent on initial triage

**With AI Risk Assessment**:
- Instant risk evaluation in seconds
- Objective, data-driven prioritization
- Consistent risk assessment across all cases
- Critical cases immediately flagged
- Focus time on investigation, not triage

**Time Savings**: Reduce triage time by 80%, allowing investigators to focus on resolution.

### Improved Decision-Making

**Data-Driven Insights**:
- Clear risk scores replace guesswork
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Comparative analysis with historical cases
- Prediction of potential outcomes
- Resource allocation guidance

**Example Scenario**:

Without AI:
```
Report: "Manager verbally abusive"
Investigator thinks: "Is this urgent? How serious? Who should handle this?"
Decision: Assigned based on gut feeling
```

With AI Risk Assessment:
```
Report: "Manager verbally abusive"
AI Analysis:
- Risk Score: 72 (High)
- Legal Risk: High (harassment, hostile work environment)
- Pattern Detected: 2 similar reports about same manager
- Impact: Potential lawsuit, team morale impact
- Recommendation: Urgent - assign senior investigator, interview witnesses within 48 hours
Decision: Informed, data-driven, appropriate urgency
```

### Enhanced Compliance

**Regulatory Alignment**:
- Identifies reports requiring expedited handling under [EU Directive](/compliance/eu-directive)
- Flags [SOX](/compliance/sox) financial misconduct for proper procedures
- Ensures [GDPR](/compliance/gdpr) high-risk data breaches get immediate attention
- Documents risk assessment for [audit trail](/compliance/audit-trail)

**Defensible Decisions**:
- AI-generated risk scores provide objective justification
- Demonstrates systematic approach to regulators
- Proves appropriate prioritization
- Shows due diligence in case handling

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Risk Scoring

Every report receives an instant risk score upon submission.

**Risk Dashboard**:
- View all cases by risk score
- Filter by severity level
- Sort by risk dimensions
- Track score changes over time
- Export risk reports

**Access Risk Scores**:
1. Dashboard > Cases > Risk View
2. See color-coded risk indicators
3. Click any case for detailed risk breakdown
4. Review AI reasoning and factors
5. Override if necessary (documented)

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Risk is not one-dimensional. The AI evaluates five distinct risk dimensions:

**Dimension Breakdown**:
```
Overall Risk Score: 75 (High)

Legal Risk:        85 (Critical) ████████░░
Financial Risk:    65 (High)     ██████░░░░
Reputational Risk: 70 (High)     ███████░░░
Operational Risk:  55 (Medium)   █████░░░░░
Compliance Risk:   80 (High)     ████████░░

Primary Concern: Legal & Compliance
Secondary Concern: Reputational
```

This breakdown helps investigators understand *why* a case is high-risk and *where* to focus attention.

### 3. Impact Prediction

The AI predicts potential consequences if the issue is not addressed:

**Predicted Impacts**:
- **Legal**: Potential EEOC complaint, employment lawsuit risk
- **Financial**: Estimated exposure $50K-$200K (settlement, legal fees)
- **Reputational**: Moderate - internal issue, low public exposure risk
- **Operational**: Team disruption, potential departures
- **Timeline**: Address within 2 weeks to mitigate escalation risk

### 4. Pattern Recognition Integration

Risk Assessment integrates with [AI Pattern Detection](/ai/pattern-detection) to identify:

**Historical Patterns**:
- Similar cases involving same individuals
- Recurring issues in departments
- Emerging risk trends
- Serial violators
- Systemic problems

**Pattern Impact on Risk Score**:
- First-time issue: Baseline risk score
- Second occurrence: +10% risk score
- Third or more: +25% risk score, flagged as pattern
- Serial offender: Automatic escalation to High/Critical

### 5. Mitigation Recommendations

Beyond scoring risk, the AI suggests specific mitigation strategies:

**Example Recommendations**:
- "Interview three named witnesses within 48 hours"
- "Secure financial records before potential tampering"
- "Consider interim separation of parties"
- "Engage legal counsel given litigation risk"
- "Implement daily monitoring for retaliation signs"
- "Prepare communication plan for stakeholders"

### 6. Dynamic Re-Assessment

Risk scores are not static. As investigations progress, the AI continuously updates:

**Re-Assessment Triggers**:
- New evidence uploaded
- Witness statements added
- Additional reports filed
- Time passing without resolution
- Investigator notes updated
- External factors (e.g., news coverage)

**Example**:
```
Initial Risk Score: 55 (Medium)
After witness corroboration: 70 (High)
After discovering financial records: 85 (Critical)
Action: Case automatically escalated to senior investigator
```
