- No software installation required
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux

**Mobile Phone/Tablet**:

**Public Computer** (Library, Internet Cafe):
- Safe to use, but take precautions:
- Use private/incognito browsing mode
- Clear browser history after submission
- Don't save your tracking ID on the device

## Step-by-Step Submission Guide

### Step 1: Choose Report Type

When you access the reporting portal, you'll first choose:

**Anonymous** or **Confidential**

**For Anonymous**:
- Click "Submit Anonymously"
- No personal information will be collected
- You'll receive a tracking ID for follow-up

**For Confidential**:
- Click "Submit Confidentially"
- You'll be asked for your contact information
- Your identity will be kept confidential

### Step 2: Select Category

Choose the category that best describes your concern:

- Harassment & Discrimination
- Financial Misconduct
- Health & Safety
- Data Privacy
- Conflicts of Interest
- Other

**Why Categories Matter**:
- Routes report to appropriate team
- Helps organization track types of issues
- Ensures proper subject matter expertise

If multiple categories apply, choose the primary one. You can mention other aspects in the description.

### Step 3: Provide Incident Details

#### When Did It Happen?

**Incident Date**:
- Select the date the incident occurred
- If ongoing, select the most recent occurrence
- If you don't know exact date, estimate as closely as possible

**Time** (Optional):
- Approximate time if relevant
- Can help with verification (e.g., checking security footage)

#### Where Did It Happen?

**Location Information**:
- Building name or number
- Department or floor
- Specific room if relevant
- City/office location for multi-site organizations

**Why Location Matters**:
- Helps identify jurisdiction and relevant policies
- May reveal patterns (e.g., issues in specific departments)
- Assists with investigation logistics

### Step 4: Describe What Happened

This is the most important part of your report. Provide a clear, detailed description.

#### What to Include

**The Basic Facts**:
- Who was involved (use initials if staying anonymous)
- What happened (specific actions or behaviors)
- When it occurred (dates, frequency)
- Where it took place
- How you know about it (witnessed, heard, experienced)

**Important Details**:
- Specific quotes or statements made
- Actions taken or not taken
- Impact on you, others, or the organization
- Any previous incidents or patterns
- Whether anyone else witnessed it

**Evidence or Proof**:
- Names of potential witnesses
- Documents that support your claim
- Emails, messages, or recordings (if legal)
- Photos or videos
- Transaction records
- Any other relevant information

#### Writing Tips

✅ **Be Specific**: Instead of "John was rude," write "On March 15th, John called me incompetent in front of the team during the 2pm meeting"

✅ **Use Facts**: Focus on what you saw, heard, or experienced, not assumptions about motives

✅ **Be Clear**: Write as if the reader knows nothing about the situation

✅ **Be Chronological**: Describe events in the order they happened

✅ **Separate Facts from Opinions**: Make it clear when you're stating a fact vs. your interpretation

❌ **Avoid**: Vague statements, exaggerations, or unverified rumors

#### Example Description

**Poor Example**:
"My manager is terrible and treats everyone badly. Something should be done."

**Good Example**:
"On March 1st, 8th, and 15th, my manager Sarah J. made comments about my age during team meetings, saying things like 'maybe you're too old to understand this technology' and 'younger people are more adaptable.' These comments were made in front of my colleagues Tom M., Jennifer S., and Alex P. On March 20th, I was passed over for a promotion that went to a younger colleague with less experience. I believe my age (52) was a factor in this decision."

### Step 5: Upload Supporting Evidence (Optional)

If you have documents, photos, or files that support your report, you can upload them securely.

**Accepted File Types**:
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- Images: JPG, PNG, GIF
- Spreadsheets: XLS, XLSX, CSV
- Other: ZIP archives

**File Size Limit**: 10MB per file, 50MB total per report

**What to Upload**:
- Relevant emails or messages
- Photos of safety hazards
- Financial records or receipts
- Screenshots of inappropriate content
- Copies of relevant policies
- Any other supporting documentation

**Important**:
- Remove any identifying information if reporting anonymously
- Check metadata (many files contain hidden identifying data)
- Ensure files don't contain viruses or malware
- Don't upload anything illegal or irrelevant

**How Files Are Handled**:
- [Encrypted during upload](/reporting/encryption) using AES-256 encryption
- Stored securely with your report
- Only accessible to authorized case handlers
- Can be viewed through the encrypted platform
- Not accessible to unauthorized parties

### Step 6: Add Witness Information (Optional)

If there were witnesses to the incident, you can provide their information.

**What to Include**:
- Witness names (or initials if anonymous)
- Department or role
- What they witnessed
- How to contact them (if appropriate)

**Why Witnesses Matter**:
- Corroborate your account
- Provide additional perspective
- Strengthen the investigation
- May have noticed details you missed

**Anonymous Reporting Note**:
- Be careful not to identify yourself through witness information
- Use initials or first names only
- Don't list only witnesses who would identify you

### Step 7: Review and Submit

Before submitting, review your report:

**Check for**:
- Spelling and clarity
- All relevant details included
- Files attached correctly
- Category selected appropriately
- Dates and locations accurate

**Remove**:
- Identifying information (if anonymous)
- Irrelevant details
- Emotion or inflammatory language
- Unverified information

**Add**:
- Any additional context
- Clarification of complex details
- Explanation of why this matters

Once you're satisfied, click **"Submit Report"**.

### Step 8: Save Your Tracking ID

**CRITICAL STEP**: After submission, you'll be shown a unique tracking ID. Learn more about [using your tracking ID](/reporting/tracking-report).

**Format**: DIS-XXXXXXXX (e.g., DIS-A7B9C2D1)

**Important**:
- ✅ **SAVE THIS ID SECURELY** - You'll need it to check status and communicate
- ✅ Write it down in a safe place
- ✅ Take a screenshot and store it securely
- ✅ Save it in a password manager

**Never**:
- ❌ Share it with anyone (it's like a password to your report)
- ❌ Store it on work devices (if you want to remain anonymous)
- ❌ Include it in emails
- ❌ Write it where others might see it

**If You Lose Your Tracking ID**:
- Anonymous reports: Cannot be recovered (by design for security)
