# Report Types

Disclosurely supports two types of report submissions: Anonymous and Confidential. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right approach.

## Anonymous Reports

**Complete anonymity guaranteed** - no personal information collected or stored.

### How It Works
- Submit report without providing identity
- Content encrypted client-side before transmission
- Receive unique tracking ID (DIS-XXXXXXXX)
- Track status and communicate via tracking ID
- Organization cannot identify you

### Best For
- Sensitive issues where retaliation is feared
- Situations requiring maximum privacy
- When you don't need direct communication
- Reports about senior leadership
- Concerns about investigation impartiality

### Features
✅ [End-to-end encryption](/reporting/encryption)
✅ Zero-knowledge architecture
✅ [Two-way secure messaging](/reporting/secure-messaging)
✅ Status tracking
✅ File uploads supported
✅ Cannot be traced to you

### Limitations
- Cannot provide direct follow-up (use messaging instead)
- If tracking ID is lost, cannot recover access
- More difficult for investigators to clarify details

## Confidential Reports

**Identity known to organization but kept confidential** - easier communication while protecting privacy.

### How It Works
- Provide your contact information
- Identity known to authorized personnel only
- Direct communication possible
- Protected from unauthorized disclosure
- Still encrypted and secure

### Best For
- Issues where you're comfortable sharing identity
- When direct communication is important
- Situations requiring your specific knowledge
- Follow-up clarification likely needed
- When you want to participate in investigation

### Features
✅ Secure and encrypted
✅ Direct communication
✅ Easier follow-up
✅ Identity protected from unauthorized access
✅ Can participate in investigation
✅ Receive direct updates

### Protections
- Identity shared on need-to-know basis only
- Protected from retaliation
- Audit trail of who accesses your information
- Confidentiality maintained in investigation

## Choosing the Right Type

**Choose Anonymous If:**
- You fear retaliation
- Issue involves senior management
- Maximum privacy is priority
- You're uncomfortable revealing identity
- Issue is highly sensitive

**Choose Confidential If:**
- You're comfortable sharing identity
- Direct communication is valuable
- You want to participate in process
- Issue requires your specific expertise
- You trust the investigation process

## Switching Between Types

**Can I make an anonymous report confidential?**
Yes - you can reveal your identity by including it in a message.

**Can I make a confidential report anonymous?**
No - once identity is shared, it cannot be undone.

## Best Practices

**For Anonymous Reports:**
- Save tracking ID securely
- Don't include identifying information
- Use personal devices/networks
- Avoid patterns that might identify you
- Check status from safe locations

**For Confidential Reports:**
- Provide accurate contact information
- Respond promptly to follow-up questions
- Document any retaliation attempts
- Keep copies of relevant evidence
- Maintain discretion about investigation
