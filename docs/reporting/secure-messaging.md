# Secure Messaging

Communicate securely with investigators while maintaining your anonymity. Two-way encrypted messaging allows dialogue without compromising privacy.

## How Secure Messaging Works

### For Anonymous Reports
- Messages encrypted end-to-end
- Your identity remains protected
- Communicate via tracking ID
- No email or personal information needed
- Cannot be traced back to you

### For Confidential Reports
- Encrypted communication
- Direct dialogue possible
- Faster clarification
- Email notifications available
- Identity protected from unauthorized access

## Sending Messages

### Access Messaging

1. Visit status lookup page
2. Enter your tracking ID
3. Scroll to messaging section
4. Type your message
5. Click "Send"

Your message is:
- Encrypted before sending
- Delivered immediately
- Visible only to authorized case handlers
- Logged in case timeline

### What to Include

**Be specific**:
- Answer questions directly
- Provide requested information
- Add relevant new details
- Clarify previous statements

**Maintain privacy** (if anonymous):
- Avoid identifying information
- Don't reveal your identity
- Be vague about unique details
- Protect your anonymity

## Receiving Messages

### Checking for New Messages

**Anonymous Reports**:

- Messages appear in chronological order
- No email notification

**Confidential Reports**:

- All messages encrypted

### Types of Messages You Might Receive

**Clarification Questions**:
- "Can you provide more detail about the date?"
- "Which department did this occur in?"
- "Were there any other witnesses?"

**Evidence Requests**:
- "Do you have any documentation?"
- "Can you provide specific examples?"
- "Are there emails or messages related to this?"

**Timeline Confirmation**:

- "How long has this been occurring?"
- "When did you first notice this?"

**Update Messages**:

## Message Security

### Encryption

- Case handlers assigned to your report
- Organization administrators
- You (via tracking ID)

**Who cannot access**:
- Unassigned team members
- Other organizations
- Disclosurely support staff
- Anyone without authorization

### Audit Trail

All message access is logged:
- Who viewed messages

- What actions were taken
- [Tamper-evident audit logs](/compliance/audit-trail)

## Message History

### Viewing Past Messages
