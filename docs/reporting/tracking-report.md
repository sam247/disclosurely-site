# Tracking Your Report

Use your tracking ID to check the status of your report, receive updates, and communicate with investigators anytime.

## Your Tracking ID

Every report receives a unique tracking ID in the format: **DIS-XXXXXXXX**

### What It's Used For
- Check report status anytime
- Receive updates and messages
- Communicate with investigators
- View investigation progress
- See resolution outcome

### Important Security Notes
⚠️ **Keep your tracking ID secure** - it's like a password to your report
⚠️ **Don't share it** - anyone with the ID can access your report
⚠️ **Save it securely** - write it down or use a password manager
⚠️ **Can't be recovered if lost** (anonymous reports) - this is by design for security

## Checking Report Status
