# GDPR Data Subject Requests

Manage GDPR data subject rights efficiently with automated request workflows, compliance tracking, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Overview

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals have specific rights regarding their personal data. Disclosurely provides comprehensive tools to handle these requests while maintaining compliance and protecting whistleblower anonymity.

**Data Subject Rights:**
- **Right to Access** (Article 15) - Obtain copy of personal data
- **Right to Erasure** (Article 17) - "Right to be Forgotten"
- **Right to Rectification** (Article 16) - Correct inaccurate data
- **Right to Data Portability** (Article 20) - Receive data in machine-readable format
- **Right to Restriction** (Article 18) - Limit processing
- **Right to Object** (Article 21) - Object to processing

**Access:** Dashboard > Compliance > GDPR Requests

**Learn More:** [GDPR Compliance](/compliance/gdpr)

## Types of GDPR Requests

### Data Access Requests (SAR)

**Subject Access Request (SAR):**

Individuals can request a copy of all personal data the organization holds about them.

**What Must Be Provided:**
- All personal data processed
- Purposes of processing
- Categories of data
- Recipients of data
- Retention periods
- Source of data (if not from data subject)
- Existence of automated decision-making

**Timeline:** 1 month (extendable to 3 months for complex requests)

**How Disclosurely Handles SARs:**

1. **Request Submission:**
   - Data subject submits request via portal or email
   - Identity verification required (prevent fraudulent requests)
   - Request logged with timestamp

2. **Automated Data Collection:**
   - System searches all databases for personal data
   - Compiles user account information
   - Gathers submitted reports (if applicable)
   - Collects communication history
   - Retrieves access logs

3. **Review & Redaction:**
   - Admins review compiled data
   - Redact third-party personal data (protect others' privacy)
   - Remove legally privileged information
   - Ensure no investigative compromise (for active cases)

4. **Response Delivery:**
   - Data packaged in machine-readable format (JSON, CSV)
   - PDF summary for human readability
   - Secure encrypted delivery
   - Confirmation of delivery logged

**Cost:** Free for first request; reasonable fee for excessive/repetitive requests

### Data Erasure Requests

**Right to Be Forgotten:**

Individuals can request deletion of their personal data when:
- No longer necessary for original purpose
- Consent withdrawn (where consent was basis)
- Processing unlawful
- Legal obligation to erase
- Data subject objects and no overriding legitimate grounds

**Exceptions (Cannot Erase):**
- Legal obligation requires retention
- Public interest (archiving, research)
- Legal claims (defense or establishment)
- Freedom of expression
- Active investigation ongoing

**Whistleblowing Context:**

⚠️ **Special Considerations:**
- **Active Cases:** Cannot erase during investigation (legal obligation)
- **Retention Periods:** Must retain per [SOX](/compliance/sox), [EU Directive](/compliance/eu-directive)
- **Anonymous Reports:** Cannot erase what cannot be linked to individual
- **Legal Holds:** Cannot erase data under legal hold

**How Disclosurely Handles Erasure:**

1. **Request Review:**
   - Assess if exception applies
   - Check active investigations
   - Verify retention requirements
   - Evaluate legal obligations

2. **Approval Workflow:**
   - Admin reviews request
   - Legal review if needed
   - Approve or reject with reason
   - Document decision

3. **Erasure Execution:**
   - If approved: Permanent deletion
   - Backup purging scheduled
   - [Audit trail](/features/audit-trail) entry (irrevocable)
   - Confirmation sent to data subject

4. **Partial Erasure:**
   - Some data retained (legal requirements)
   - Explain to data subject what remains and why
   - Document justification

**Timeline:** 1 month from verification

### Data Rectification Requests

**Right to Correction:**

Individuals can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.

**Scenarios:**
- Name misspelled in account
- Incorrect email address
- Outdated contact information
- Inaccurate user profile details

**Process:**
1. Data subject identifies inaccuracy
2. Provides correct information
3. Admin verifies and updates
4. Confirmation sent
5. Change logged in [audit trail](/features/audit-trail)

**Timeline:** 1 month

**Not Applicable To:**
- Report content (whistleblower allegations are their statement)
- Investigation findings (factual record)
- Historical audit logs (immutable)

### Data Portability Requests

**Right to Receive Data:**

Data subjects can request their data in structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

**What's Included:**
- User account data
- Submitted reports metadata
- Communication logs
- User preferences

**Formats Provided:**
- JSON (complete structured data)
- CSV (tabular data)
- XML (structured hierarchical data)

**Transmission:**
- Direct download (encrypted ZIP)
- Secure email delivery
- Transfer to another controller (if requested)

**Timeline:** 1 month

### Restriction of Processing

**Right to Limit Processing:**

Data subjects can request restriction while:
- Accuracy is being verified
- Processing is unlawful (but they don't want erasure)
- Organization no longer needs data (but subject needs it for legal claims)
- Objection is being verified

**How Restriction Works:**
- Data marked as "Restricted" in system
- Cannot be processed except:
  - Storage
  - Legal claims
  - Protection of others' rights
  - Public interest
- Restriction lifted when grounds no longer apply

**Timeline:** 1 month

### Integration with Retention Policies

**Coordinated Deletion:**

GDPR erasure requests integrate with [data retention policies](/compliance/retention):

**Retention-First Approach:**

- Retain if legally required
- Explain retention to data subject
- Schedule erasure when retention period ends

**Retention Override:**
- GDPR erasure can override standard retention
