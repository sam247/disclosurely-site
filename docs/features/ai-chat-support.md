### 4. Best Practice Recommendations

Get expert advice on using Disclosurely effectively.

**Example Conversation**:
```
You: "What's the best way to organize my case handlers?"

AI: CASE HANDLER ORGANIZATION BEST PRACTICES

RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:

1. ROLE-BASED TEAMS:
   - Assign handlers by expertise area
   - Example teams:
     • HR Violations (harassment, discrimination)
     • Financial Misconduct (fraud, embezzlement)
     • Safety & Security (workplace safety, threats)
     • Ethics & Conduct (conflicts of interest, policy violations)

2. ASSIGNMENT RULES:
   Set up automatic routing based on:
   - Report category → Relevant team
   - Urgency level → Senior vs. junior handlers
   - Keywords → Specialist handlers
   - Example: "harassment" keywords → HR team

3. ESCALATION PATHS:
   - Junior handler reviews initially
   - Complex cases escalate to senior handler
   - Critical issues notify leadership
   - Use SLA policies to track timing

4. BACKUP COVERAGE:
   - Assign secondary handlers for each category
   - Cross-train team members
   - Document procedures for consistency

5. WORKLOAD BALANCING:
   - Monitor case counts per handler
   - Adjust assignment rules periodically
   - Use analytics to identify bottlenecks

EXAMPLE SETUP:
Assignment Rule: "Financial Reports → Finance Team"
- Category: Financial
- Assign to: finance-team
- Priority: 10
- Status: Active

This automatically routes financial misconduct reports to
your finance specialists for faster, more expert handling.

Would you like help setting up any of these?
