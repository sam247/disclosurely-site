**How to Use**:
```
You: "Check for similar cases involving this manager"
```

**AI Response Example**:
```
PATTERN ANALYSIS

SIMILAR CASES FOUND: 2

CASE #1: DIS-B3C7D9E2 (6 months ago)
• Type: Workplace bullying
• Subject: Same manager (Sarah J.)

PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
• Manager has history of problematic behavior

```

### 4. Risk Assessment

**How to Use**:
```
You: "Assess the risk level of this case"
```

**AI Response Example**:
```
RISK ASSESSMENT

OVERALL RISK LEVEL: HIGH

LEGAL RISK: HIGH
• Age discrimination is prohibited under employment law
• Multiple incidents strengthen potential claim
• Witnesses present make this highly credible
• Promotion denial adds significant weight
• Company may face EEOC complaint or lawsuit
• Previous similar complaints suggest pattern

REPUTATIONAL RISK: MEDIUM
• Could damage employer brand if public
• May affect employee morale if unresolved
• Social media risk if reporter goes public

FINANCIAL RISK: MEDIUM-HIGH
• Potential lawsuit costs
• Settlement or judgment
• EEOC investigation costs
• Lost productivity
• Recruitment/replacement costs

OPERATIONAL RISK: LOW-MEDIUM
• Team dynamics affected
• Management capability questioned
• Temporary disruption during investigation

COMPLIANCE RISK: HIGH
• Clear policy violation
• Potential regulatory violation
• Audit findings risk
• Documentation essential

MITIGATION PRIORITY: URGENT
• Act swiftly and decisively
• Document everything thoroughly
• Engage legal counsel if appropriate
• Take interim protective measures
• Monitor for retaliation
```

### 5. Document Analysis

**How to Use**:
1. Click **"Upload Document"**
2. Select policy, handbook, or procedure
3. Ask AI to reference it

**Example**:
```

AI: Based on your Anti-Harassment Policy (uploaded March 2024):

POLICY VIOLATION: YES

Your policy states:
"Harassment based on age, race, gender, or other protected characteristics is strictly prohibited. This includes verbal comments, jokes, or actions that create an intimidating or hostile work environment."

VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED:
1. Age-based comments ("too old to understand technology")

### Comparative Analysis

Compare cases to identify trends:

```
You: "Compare this case to other harassment cases this year"

AI: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

HARASSMENT CASES THIS YEAR: 12 total

THIS CASE vs. AVERAGE:
• Severity: Higher (multiple witnesses)
• Evidence Quality: Better (specific quotes)
• Response Time: Standard
• Pattern Risk: Higher (repeat offender)

TRENDS IDENTIFIED:
• 40% involve management (vs 25% last year)
• Age discrimination up 50%
• Cases with witnesses resolve 30% faster
• 75% result in manager training or discipline

BENCHMARK RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on similar cases, typical outcomes include:
• Formal warning: 50%
• Suspension: 25%
• Termination: 15%
• Training only: 10%

Given pattern and severity, recommend:
Formal warning minimum, consider suspension
```

### What-If Scenarios

Explore potential outcomes:

```
You: "What if we just give the manager more training?"

AI: SCENARIO ANALYSIS: Training-Only Response

PROS:
• Lower conflict/resistance
• Faster resolution
• Less disruptive
• Lower costs

CONS:
• Insufficient given pattern (2 prior complaints)
• May not prevent recurrence
• Could be seen as inadequate by reporter
• Doesn't address seriousness
• May encourage future violations
• Potential legal liability if pattern continues

RISK ASSESSMENT:
HIGH RISK - Training alone is likely insufficient

RECOMMENDATION:
Training should be part of response, not entire response.
Consider: Formal warning + training + probation + regular check-ins

SUPPORTING DATA:
• Cases with training-only after patterns: 60% recurrence
• Cases with progressive discipline: 15% recurrence
• Legal precedent favors stronger action for patterns
```

## Best Practices

### Do:

✅ **Provide Context**: Give AI complete case information
✅ **Ask Specific Questions**: More specific = better answers
✅ **Review Recommendations**: AI assists, humans decide
✅ **Upload Policies**: Help AI understand your organization
✅ **Save Important Analysis**: Download or screenshot key insights
✅ **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions for clarity
✅ **Cross-Reference**: Verify AI suggestions with policies

### Don't:

❌ **Blindly Follow**: AI is a tool, not a replacement for judgment
❌ **Share Sensitive Data Unnecessarily**: Only share what's needed
❌ **Rely Solely on AI**: Combine AI with human expertise
❌ **Ignore Red Flags**: If AI misses something obvious, note it
❌ **Skip Documentation**: Document your own analysis too
