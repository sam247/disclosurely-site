# Pattern Detection

AI-powered pattern detection analyzes your organization's whistleblowing reports to identify trends, recurring issues, related incidents, and systemic problems that might not be obvious from individual cases. This powerful feature helps investigators spot serial offenders, emerging risks, and organizational vulnerabilities before they escalate.

## What is AI Pattern Detection?

Disclosurely's Pattern Detection engine continuously analyzes all cases in your organization to identify meaningful patterns, connections, and trends. By examining similarities across allegations, subjects, departments, timeframes, and outcomes, the AI reveals insights that would take months of manual analysis to uncover.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Similar Case Detection**: Find reports with related allegations, subjects, or circumstances
- **Trend Identification**: Spot emerging issues before they become widespread problems
- **Serial Offender Recognition**: Identify individuals with multiple complaints over time
- **Department Risk Mapping**: Highlight departments with recurring misconduct
- **Network Analysis**: Discover connections between people, departments, and incidents
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Detect cyclical or time-based patterns in misconduct
- **Automated Alerts**: Receive notifications when patterns reach significance thresholds

## How AI Pattern Detection Works

### Intelligent Analysis Engine

The AI examines multiple dimensions simultaneously to identify patterns:

1. **Data Collection**: Analyzes all historical and current cases (with proper access controls)
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies key characteristics of each case (type, people, department, severity, etc.)
3. **Similarity Matching**: Compares cases across multiple dimensions using advanced algorithms
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies statistically significant patterns and trends
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels to detected patterns (High, Medium, Low)
6. **Alert Generation**: Notifies investigators when significant patterns emerge
7. **Continuous Learning**: Refines pattern detection as more cases are processed

### Pattern Analysis Dimensions

**The AI analyzes patterns across 15+ dimensions**:

**People-Based Patterns**:
- Multiple reports about the same individual (serial offender)
- Repeated complainants (may indicate retaliation or ongoing issue)
- Common witnesses across cases
- Supervisory chain patterns
- Department or team patterns

**Allegation-Based Patterns**:
- Similar misconduct types
- Escalating severity of related allegations
- Common policy violations
- Related compliance issues
- Similar evidence types

**Location-Based Patterns**:
- Department or team clustering
- Geographic location patterns
- Remote vs. on-site patterns
- Cross-departmental patterns

**Temporal Patterns**:
- Time-of-year seasonality
- Day-of-week patterns
- Incident timing clusters
- Investigation duration patterns
- Cyclical reporting patterns

**Outcome Patterns**:
- Similar investigation outcomes
- Common recommended actions
- Policy change triggers
- Substantiation rates by type
- Resolution effectiveness

## Key Features

### 1. Similar Case Detection

Automatically identify cases related to the current investigation.

**When Viewing a Case**:
- AI displays "Similar Cases" panel
- Shows cases ranked by similarity (0-100% match)
- Explains why cases are similar
- Links to related investigations
- Suggests pattern investigation approach

**Example**:

```
SIMILAR CASES DETECTED

Current Case: WB-2024-0342 (Harassment by Manager Sarah J.)
Similarity Threshold: 65%+

CASE #1: WB-2023-0189 (Similarity: 87%)
Type: Workplace Harassment
Subject: Sarah J. (same person)
Date: 6 months ago
Outcome: Verbal warning, management training
Key Similarity: Same subject, similar harassment allegations

CASE #2: WB-2023-0421 (Similarity: 72%)
Type: Hostile Work Environment
Subject: Sarah J. (same person)
Date: 1 year ago
Outcome: Coaching provided
Key Similarity: Same subject, related behavioral issues

CASE #3: WB-2024-0198 (Similarity: 68%)
Type: Management Misconduct
Subject: Different manager in same department
Date: 2 months ago
Outcome: In progress
Key Similarity: Same department, similar management issues

PATTERN ALERT: Serial Offender
Subject Sarah J. has 3 reports in 18 months. Previous interventions
(training, coaching) have not resolved behavior. Consider escalation.
```

### 2. Trend Analysis

```

### 3. Serial Offender Identification

Automatically flag individuals with multiple complaints.

**Serial Offender Criteria**:
- Multiple reports about same person (configurable threshold: 2+, 3+, etc.)
- Timeframe analysis (e.g., 3 reports in 12 months vs. 3 reports in 5 years)
- Severity consideration (multiple serious allegations vs. minor issues)
- Outcome patterns (repeat after interventions vs. first-time substantiated)
- Escalation tracking (are allegations becoming more serious?)

**Alert Trigger**:
When a new report is filed about someone with previous complaints, the AI immediately alerts investigators:

```
SERIAL OFFENDER ALERT

New Report: WB-2024-0456
Subject: Michael T., Senior Manager

PREVIOUS REPORTS:
• WB-2023-0234 (8 months ago): Bullying - SUBSTANTIATED
  Outcome: Written warning, coaching
• WB-2023-0712 (4 months ago): Retaliation - SUBSTANTIATED
  Outcome: Final written warning, management training
• WB-2024-0456 (NEW): Harassment - Under Investigation

PATTERN ASSESSMENT:
• 3 reports in 10 months
• 100% substantiation rate on closed cases
• Progressive discipline applied
• Behavior worsening despite interventions
• Multiple complainants (no repeat reporters)

RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL
• Serial offender pattern confirmed
• Previous interventions ineffective
• Legal liability high
• Termination recommended if substantiated

RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Expedite investigation (treat as urgent)
2. Consider interim suspension
3. Engage legal counsel
4. Review all previous cases for pattern
5. Prepare for potential termination
6. Monitor for additional complaints from others
```

### 4. Department Risk Mapping

**Department Analysis Metrics**:
- Report volume by department (per 100 employees)
- Substantiation rates by department
- Severity of issues by department
- Types of misconduct by department
- Investigation durations by department
- Policy violations by department

**Visual Risk Heat Map**:
```
DEPARTMENT RISK HEAT MAP (Last 12 Months)

```

### 5. Network Analysis

Discover hidden connections between people, departments, and incidents.

**Network Analysis Reveals**:
- Common supervisors across multiple cases
- Interconnected groups of complainants
- Departments with cross-functional issues
- Reporting patterns (e.g., reports often go through specific channels)
- Witness networks and credibility patterns

**Visual Network Graph**:
Shows connections between:
- Subjects of multiple complaints
- Departments with related issues
- Common witnesses
- Shared supervisors
- Related case clusters

**Example Network Pattern**:

```
NETWORK PATTERN DETECTED

Central Figure: David L., Executive Vice President

Connected Cases: 8 reports in 12 months

Network Analysis:
• David L. is direct or indirect supervisor in 8 recent cases
• 5 of 8 cases involve his direct reports as subjects
• 3 of 8 cases involve whistleblowers reporting to him
• 2 cases name him as witness to misconduct
• 60% of cases in his division vs. 20% in other divisions

Pattern Assessment:
This network pattern suggests either:
1. Toxic culture in David L.'s division
2. David L. is aware of but not addressing misconduct
3. David L. may be contributing to problematic environment
4. His division has particularly strong speak-up culture (positive)

Recommended Investigation:
• Review David L.'s knowledge of and response to prior reports
• Interview current and former employees in his division
• Assess divisional culture independently
• Review his performance management of problem employees
• Consider whether he should recuse from future investigations
```

### 6. Temporal Pattern Analysis

Identify time-based patterns in misconduct and reporting.

**Time Patterns Detected**:

**Seasonal Patterns**:
- Year-end expense fraud increases (bonus season)
- Q4 discrimination complaints (promotion cycle)
- Summer harassment reports (office social events)

**Cyclical Patterns**:
- Weekly patterns (Monday reports higher - weekend reflection)
- Monthly patterns (end-of-month financial misconduct)
- Annual patterns (performance review season)

**Event-Triggered Patterns**:
- Post-reorganization complaints spike
- After layoff announcements
- Following policy changes
- Training session aftermath (increased awareness)

**Example Temporal Alert**:

```
TEMPORAL PATTERN ALERT

Pattern: Expense Fraud Reports Peak in January

Historical Data (Last 3 Years):
• January average: 12 expense fraud reports/month
• Other months average: 3 expense fraud reports/month
• Pattern: 4x increase every January
• Timing: Reports submitted in January for December expenses

Hypothesis:
• Year-end bonus and vacation spending leads to cash flow issues
• Personal expenses mistakenly (or intentionally) claimed as business
• Rushed year-end expense processing reduces scrutiny
• Year-end audit preparation prompts discovery of fraud

Preventive Actions:
• Increase expense audit sampling in December
• Send fraud prevention reminder in November
• Enhanced approval scrutiny for December expenses
• Finance team training on fraud red flags before year-end
• Consider delaying expense reimbursement for high-risk claims

Expected Impact:
• 50% reduction in January fraud reports
• Earlier detection of year-end fraud attempts
• Deterrent effect from increased scrutiny
```

## Privacy and Security

### Data Access Controls

**Pattern Detection Respects Permissions**:
- AI only analyzes cases the user has permission to view
- Cross-organizational patterns not visible (multi-tenant isolation)
- Confidential information protected in pattern reports
- Anonymous reporter identities never included in patterns

### GDPR and Privacy Compliance

**Privacy by Design**:
- Pattern analysis uses pseudonymized data where possible
- Personal data minimized in pattern reports
- Purpose limitation: Patterns used only for compliance and risk management
- Data subjects can request pattern data deletion (subject to legal retention)
- See [GDPR Compliance](/compliance/gdpr) for full details

### Bias Prevention

**Avoiding Algorithmic Bias**:
- AI does not profile based on protected characteristics
- Patterns based on behavior and incidents, not demographics
- Regular bias audits of pattern detection algorithm
- Human oversight required for pattern-based decisions
- Investigators can contest or override pattern assessments

## Configuration and Setup

### Best Practices

**Do's**:
✅ **Investigate Patterns**: Don't ignore pattern alerts - they indicate real risk
✅ **Combine with Human Judgment**: Patterns inform, not determine, decisions
✅ **Act on Systemic Issues**: Use patterns to identify root causes and fix them
✅ **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track whether interventions reduce patterns
✅ **Share Appropriately**: Brief leadership on significant patterns
✅ **Update Regularly**: Review pattern settings quarterly

**Don'ts**:
❌ **Don't Profile Individuals**: Use patterns to assess behavior, not predict misconduct
❌ **Don't Ignore Context**: Patterns need investigation, not automatic action
❌ **Don't Violate Privacy**: Respect confidentiality even when patterns detected
❌ **Don't Dismiss Outliers**: Individual cases matter even without patterns
❌ **Don't Over-React**: Correlation doesn't always mean causation
