# Content Generation

AI-powered content generation transforms hours of investigation documentation into minutes. Automatically create investigation summaries, draft communication templates, generate comprehensive reports, and produce policy recommendations using intelligent AI that understands compliance and investigation best practices.

## What is AI Content Generation?

Disclosurely's AI Content Generation engine automates the creation of investigation documentation, saving investigators significant time while maintaining professional quality and regulatory compliance. Instead of spending hours writing reports from scratch, investigators can generate comprehensive drafts in seconds and refine them as needed.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Investigation Summaries**: Concise overviews of complex cases for leadership review
- **Communication Templates**: Professional messages for reporters, subjects, and stakeholders
- **Investigation Reports**: Comprehensive documentation of findings and recommendations
- **Policy Recommendations**: Suggested policy updates based on investigation insights
- **Evidence Summaries**: Structured summaries of witness statements and documentation
- **Timeline Generation**: Chronological event timelines from case notes and evidence

## How AI Content Generation Works

### Intelligent Document Creation

The AI analyzes your investigation data and generates contextually appropriate content:

3. **Template Selection**: Chooses appropriate format and structure for the content type
4. **Content Generation**: Creates professional, accurate draft content
5. **Compliance Checking**: Ensures content meets regulatory requirements
6. **Human Review**: Investigator reviews, edits, and approves before use

### Content Quality Standards

**Every AI-generated document includes**:
- Professional tone appropriate for compliance documentation
- Factual accuracy based on case evidence
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, EU Directive, SOX requirements)
- Clear structure with logical flow
- Proper legal terminology and phrasing
- Customizable for your organization's style

INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

Case ID: WB-2024-0342
Type: Financial Misconduct - Expense Fraud
Status: Investigation Completed
Date: March 15, 2024

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This investigation examined allegations of systematic expense fraud by
a mid-level manager over an 18-month period. The investigation
substantiated the allegations, identifying $47,500 in fraudulent
expense claims. The subject has been terminated, and criminal referral
is recommended.

KEY FINDINGS
• Subject submitted 124 fraudulent expense claims totaling $47,500
• Fraudulent claims included personal expenses, inflated amounts, and
  duplicate submissions
• Pattern established through forensic accounting review
• No evidence of collusion with other employees

INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES
• Reviewed 18 months of expense records
• Conducted interviews with 5 witnesses
• Forensic accounting analysis performed
• Examined credit card statements and receipts
• Reviewed approval workflows

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Terminate subject's employment (completed)
2. Refer to law enforcement for criminal prosecution
3. Pursue civil recovery of funds
4. Implement enhanced expense audit controls
5. Provide fraud awareness training to managers
6. Review expense approval workflows

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Current expense policy lacks adequate controls for high-value claims.
Recommend implementing dual-approval for expenses over $1,000 and
quarterly audit sampling.

POLICY RECOMMENDATION

Based On: Case WB-2024-0342 (Expense Fraud)
Date: March 15, 2024

ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Current expense policy (Section 4.2) allows single-manager approval
for all expenses regardless of amount. This enabled systematic fraud
totaling $47,500 over 18 months without detection.

RECOMMENDED POLICY CHANGES

1. DUAL APPROVAL FOR HIGH-VALUE EXPENSES
   Current: "All expenses must be approved by direct manager"
   Proposed: "Expenses over $1,000 require approval from direct manager
   AND department head or finance director"

2. QUARTERLY AUDIT SAMPLING
   New Addition: "Finance department will conduct random audit of 5%
   of expense claims each quarter, with focus on high-value and
   frequent claimants"

3. FRAUD INDICATORS TRAINING
   New Addition: "All managers with expense approval authority must
   complete annual training on fraud indicators and expense policy
   requirements"

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
• Week 1-2: Legal review of policy changes
• Week 3: Approve updated policy
• Week 4: Communicate changes to all employees
• Week 5: Implement dual-approval workflow in expense system
• Week 6: Train managers on new procedures
• Ongoing: Quarterly audit program begins

EXPECTED IMPACT
• Fraud risk reduced by requiring collusion for high-value fraud
• Earlier detection through quarterly audits
• Improved manager vigilance through training
• Stronger controls without excessive burden

MONITORING
• Track dual-approval compliance rate
• Review audit findings quarterly
• Assess training completion rates
• Monitor for control circumvention attempts

**Purpose Limitation**: Content used only for investigation and compliance
**Accuracy**: AI generates factual content based on evidence
**Storage Limitation**: Generated content follows retention policies
**Security**: All content encrypted and access-controlled

### Quality Control

**Human Review Required**:
- AI generates drafts, not final documents
- Investigators must review all generated content
- Factual accuracy verification required
- Tone and appropriateness check
- Compliance review before sending/publishing
- Edit and customize as needed

**AI Does Not**:
- Auto-send communications
- Make investigative decisions
- Determine outcomes or discipline

## Configuration and Best Practices

### Setup

**Enable AI Content Generation**:
