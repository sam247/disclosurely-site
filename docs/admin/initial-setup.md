This link is your organization's anonymous reporting portal where whistleblowers can [submit anonymous reports](/reporting/how-to-submit):
- Submit anonymous reports
- Track report status
- Communicate securely with your team

**How to Find Your Link**:
1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Secure Link**
2. Copy your unique secure submission link
3. Share this link with employees via:
   - Internal website/intranet
   - Email signatures
   - Employee handbooks
