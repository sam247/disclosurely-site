## Overview

Effective data retention policies balance:

- **Regulatory compliance**: Meet minimum retention requirements
- **Legal defensibility**: Preserve evidence for potential litigation
- **Privacy rights**: Delete data when no longer needed (GDPR)

## Setting Retention Policies

### Default Retention Period

**Recommended Default**: 7 years from case resolution

**Rationale**:
- Meets most regulatory requirements
- Covers litigation limitation periods
- Balances retention and privacy
- Industry standard

**Configure in Disclosurely**:
1. Dashboard > [Organization Settings](/admin/organization-settings)
2. Data Retention Policies
3. Set "Default Retention Period"
4. Enter years (e.g., 7)
5. Save changes

**Applies To**:
- All cases unless specific policy
- New cases from configuration date
- Existing cases (optional update)

### Category-Specific Retention

Different case types may warrant different retention:

**Financial Misconduct**:
- **Period**: 10 years
- **Reason**: Complex litigation, regulatory scrutiny
- **Examples**: Fraud, embezzlement, bribery

**Harassment & Discrimination**:
- **Period**: 10-15 years
- **Reason**: Long limitation periods, reputation risk
- **Examples**: Sexual harassment, discrimination, bullying

**Health & Safety**:
- **Period**: 10 years
- **Reason**: Personal injury claims, regulatory requirements
- **Examples**: Workplace accidents, safety violations

**Data Breaches**:
- **Period**: 10 years
- **Reason**: GDPR requirements, litigation risk
- **Examples**: Data theft, unauthorized access

**Minor Policy Violations**:
- **Period**: 3-5 years
- **Reason**: Low risk, privacy considerations
- **Examples**: Tardiness, minor expense issues

**Withdrawn Reports**:
- **Period**: 1-3 years
- **Reason**: Limited utility, privacy considerations
- **Examples**: Reporter withdrew, duplicate report

**Configure Category Retention**:
1. Dashboard > Organization Settings
2. Data Retention Policies
3. "Category-Specific Retention"
4. Select category
5. Set retention period
6. Document reason
7. Save

### Outcome-Specific Retention

**Substantiated Cases**:
- **Period**: Longer retention (10-15 years)
- **Reason**: Evidence of misconduct, potential recurrence

**Unsubstantiated Cases**:
- **Period**: Moderate retention (5-7 years)
- **Reason**: Potential future claims, pattern detection

**False/Malicious Reports**:
- **Period**: Longer retention (7-10 years)
- **Reason**: Protect against future false accusations

**Inconclusive Cases**:
- **Period**: Standard retention (7 years)
- **Reason**: Incomplete information, potential relevance

**Configure**:
1. Settings > Retention Policies
2. "Outcome-Based Retention"
3. Set periods for each outcome type
4. Save changes

### Minimum and Maximum Limits

**Set Organizational Limits**:

**Minimum Retention**:
- Cannot delete before this period
- Even if category policy shorter
- Ensures regulatory compliance
- Example: 3 years minimum

**Maximum Retention**:
- Cannot retain longer than this period
- Unless legal hold or exception
- Privacy protection (GDPR)
- Example: 15 years maximum

**Configure**:
1. Settings > Retention Policies
2. "Organizational Limits"
3. Set minimum years (e.g., 3)
4. Set maximum years (e.g., 15)
5. Document rationale
6. Save

**Override Requires**:
- Administrator approval
- Documented justification
- Legal hold mechanism
- Audit trail

## Calculating Retention Period

### Start Date

**When Does Retention Period Begin?**

**Case Resolution Date** (Recommended):
- When case status set to "Resolved"
- Clear trigger point
- Easy to calculate
- Disclosurely default

**Case Closure Date**:
- When all follow-up actions complete
- May be weeks/months after resolution
- More conservative

**Last Activity Date**:
- Last note, message, or evidence added
- Can extend indefinitely
- Not recommended for primary calculation

**Configure**:
- Settings > Retention Policies
- "Retention Start Date"
- Select trigger (Resolution, Closure, Last Activity)
- Save

### End Date Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Deletion Eligibility Date = Start Date + Retention Period
```

**Example**:
- Case resolved: January 15, 2024
- Retention policy: 7 years
- Deletion eligible: January 15, 2031

**Automatic Calculation**:
- Disclosurely calculates automatically
- Visible on case details page
- Included in retention reports
- Updates if policy changes

**Policy Changes**:
- Apply to new cases immediately
- Existing cases: Optional update
- Can grandfather old cases
- Document approach

### Extensions and Adjustments

**Extend Individual Case Retention**:

1. **Open Case**
   - Navigate to case details
   - View current deletion date

2. **Request Extension**

   - Add justification (required)
   - Submit request

3. **Approval**
   - Admin or Compliance Officer approves
   - New deletion date calculated
   - Audit log entry created
   - Notifications sent

**Common Reasons for Extension**:
- Related ongoing investigation

## Legal Holds

### When to Apply Legal Hold

**Triggers**:

   - Click "Legal Hold"
   - Complete form:
     - Matter name/number
     - Reason for hold
     - Legal counsel contact
     - Expected duration
     - Related cases
   - Submit for approval

3. **Approval**
   - Administrator approves
   - Legal counsel may review
   - Hold activated
   - Notifications sent

4. **Hold Active**
   - Case flagged prominently
   - Deletion prevented
   - All users notified
   - Audit log entry
   - Monitoring activated

**Bulk Legal Holds**:
- Hold multiple cases simultaneously
- Filter by criteria (date range, category)
- Apply hold to all matching
- Document scope clearly

### Managing Legal Holds

**Monitoring**:
- Dashboard > Legal Holds
- View all active holds
- Duration of hold

   - Litigation settled
   - Investigation closed
   - Regulatory matter concluded
   - Tribunal complete

2. **Request Release**
   - Legal counsel approval required

   - Normal retention policy resumes
   - Deletion date recalculated
   - Notifications sent
   - Audit log entry

**Communication**:
- Notify all stakeholders
- Document hold and release
- Train staff on hold obligations
- Ensure compliance

## Anonymization Alternative

### When to Anonymize vs. Delete

**Anonymize Instead of Delete**:
- Want to retain for statistical analysis
- Pattern detection valuable
- Benchmarking purposes
- Training and improvement
- No personal data needed

**Delete Completely**:
- Privacy request (GDPR right to erasure)
- No legitimate need
- Retention period expired
- Low value information
- Storage constraints

### Anonymization Process

**What Gets Anonymized**:
- Reporter identity removed
- Subject identity removed
- Witness names removed
- Locations generalized
- Dates generalized
- Identifying details removed

**What Gets Retained**:
- Case category
- Allegation type
- Investigation outcome
- Resolution method
- Timeline (approximate)
- Process followed

**Cannot Re-Identify**:
- True anonymization, not pseudonymization
- Cannot reverse process
- No linkage to individuals
- GDPR compliant
- Useful for analysis

**How to Anonymize**:
1. Dashboard > Data Retention
2. Select cases
3. "Anonymize Instead of Delete"
4. Confirm action
5. Anonymization executed
6. Audit log entry

## Retention Reports
