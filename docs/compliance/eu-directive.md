## External Reporting Channels

### When Whistleblowers May Go External

**Article 10 - External Reporting Channels**

Reporters may go directly to authorities if:
- No internal channels available
- Internal channels not functioning properly
- Reasonable belief that retaliation will occur
- Reasonable belief that breach may constitute imminent or manifest danger to public interest
- Reasonable belief that investigation won't be handled appropriately
- Previous internal report not followed up

**Implication**: Organizations should ensure internal channels are effective to encourage internal reporting first.

### Competent Authorities

Each member state must designate authorities to receive external reports:

**Examples**:
- Financial regulators
- Data protection authorities
- Environmental agencies
- Health and safety authorities
- Anti-corruption bodies

**Your Responsibility**:
- Inform employees about external reporting options
- Provide contact information for relevant authorities
- Include in whistleblowing policy
- Do not discourage external reporting

**In Disclosurely**:
- Customize information pages to include external channels
- Provide links to national authorities
- Explain when external reporting appropriate
- Demonstrate internal channels are effective

## Member State Variations

### Check Your Jurisdiction

While the Directive sets minimums, member states may:
- Extend protection to more categories of workers
- Lower the 50-employee threshold
- Add reporting channel requirements
- Impose stricter timelines
- Require additional measures
- Impose penalties for non-compliance

**Examples of Variations**:

**Germany (HinSchG)**:
- Requires external "ombudsperson" option for some organizations
- Stricter penalties for non-compliance
- Specific requirements for verbal reporting

**France (Loi Waserman)**:
- Applies to all organizations with 50+ employees (no sector exceptions)
- Specific requirements for report handling
- Integration with existing alert systems

**Spain (Law 2/2023)**:
- Detailed requirements for investigation procedures
- Specific timeline for initiating investigation
- Obligation to inform reporter of investigation start

**Netherlands (House for Whistleblowers Act)**:
- Strong focus on external authority
- Specific investigation requirements
- Integration with existing whistleblower infrastructure

### Consult Local Counsel

**Important**: This documentation provides general guidance on the EU Directive. Always consult local employment and compliance counsel to ensure full compliance with your member state's specific implementation.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

### Member State Penalties

Each member state establishes penalties for:
- Failure to establish internal channels
- Breaching confidentiality
- Retaliating against whistleblowers
- Obstructing reporting
- Not following up on reports

**Examples**:
- Fines (amounts vary by member state)
- Criminal penalties in some jurisdictions
- Personal liability for managers
- Injunctions to establish channels
- Reputational damage

### Consequences

**Beyond Regulatory Penalties**:
- Damage to reputation
- Loss of employee trust
- Litigation from whistleblowers
- Employment tribunal claims
- Regulatory investigations
- Media attention
- Investor concerns

**Best Practice**: Proactive compliance is far less costly than reactive remediation.
