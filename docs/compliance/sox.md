## Dodd-Frank Act Considerations

### SEC Whistleblower Program

**Dodd-Frank Section 922**: SEC whistleblower program

**Key Points**:
- Whistleblowers may report directly to SEC
- Financial incentives for SEC reports (10-30% of sanctions)
- 120-day "look back" if internal report made first
- Companies benefit when issues reported internally first

**Encourage Internal Reporting**:
- Effective internal channels (Disclosurely)
- Prompt investigation and resolution
- Feedback to reporters
- Fair treatment
- Protection from retaliation
- Demonstrate responsiveness

**Why Internal Reporting Helps**:
- Opportunity to self-correct
- Avoid SEC investigation
- Demonstrate compliance culture
- Reduce penalties if issue found
- Maintain control of investigation
- Protect reputation

### Dodd-Frank Protections

**Additional Protections**:
- Reports to SEC protected
- Longer statute of limitations (10 years)
- Broader definition of protected activity
- More remedies available
- Bounties available

**Company Implications**:
- Cannot restrict employees from reporting to SEC
- Cannot require SEC reports to be internal first
- Cannot require waiver of bounty rights
- Severance agreements cannot prohibit SEC reports
- Confidentiality agreements must have carve-outs
