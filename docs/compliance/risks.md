# Risk Management

Comprehensive risk management for whistleblowing compliance, combining human expertise with [AI Risk Assessment](/ai/risk-assessment) to identify, evaluate, prioritize, and mitigate organizational risks identified through whistleblowing reports.

## What is Whistleblowing Risk Management?

Whistleblowing reports reveal critical risks to your organization. Effective risk management ensures you identify high-priority issues, respond appropriately, and prevent escalation into major problems like legal liability, financial losses, or reputational damage.

**Risk Categories**:
- **Legal Risk**: Regulatory violations, litigation exposure, contractual breaches
- **Financial Risk**: Fraud, embezzlement, financial misreporting, revenue impact
- **Reputational Risk**: Media exposure, brand damage, stakeholder trust erosion
- **Operational Risk**: Process failures, safety issues, business disruption
- **Compliance Risk**: Policy violations, audit findings, certification issues
- **People Risk**: Employee morale, turnover, harassment, discrimination

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Risk Identification

**Sources of Risk**:
- Whistleblower reports (primary source)
- [AI Pattern Detection](/ai/pattern-detection) identifies trends
- Internal audits and assessments
- Compliance monitoring
- External intelligence (regulatory changes, industry issues)
- Employee surveys and feedback

**Questions to Ask**:
- What is the nature of the allegation?
- Who is involved (subject, department, level)?
- What are the potential consequences?
- Is this an isolated incident or pattern?
- What regulatory requirements apply?
- What is the organization's vulnerability?

### 2. Risk Analysis

**Assess Severity**:

**Impact Dimensions**:
- **Legal Impact**: Potential litigation, regulatory enforcement, fines
- **Financial Impact**: Direct losses, remediation costs, opportunity costs
- **Reputational Impact**: Media coverage, stakeholder perception, brand value
- **Operational Impact**: Business disruption, productivity losses, service delivery
- **People Impact**: Employee morale, turnover, recruitment challenges

**Likelihood Assessment**:
- How credible is the report? (evidence quality, witness availability)
- Is this an ongoing issue or resolved?
- How many people affected?
- Is there a pattern of similar issues?
- What controls exist (or don't exist)?

**Combined Risk Score** = Impact × Likelihood

**AI-Powered Risk Scoring**:
Disclosurely's [AI Risk Assessment](/ai/risk-assessment) automatically evaluates all reports across 20+ risk factors, providing instant risk scores (0-100) and severity classifications (Critical, High, Medium, Low). This ensures:
- Objective, consistent risk assessment
- Instant prioritization
- Pattern-based risk adjustment
- Continuous re-assessment as investigations progress

### 3. Risk Prioritization

**Risk Matrix**:

```
Impact →    Low      Medium    High      Critical
Likelihood
↓
High        MEDIUM   HIGH      HIGH      CRITICAL
Medium      LOW      MEDIUM    HIGH      HIGH
Low         LOW      LOW       MEDIUM    MEDIUM
Unlikely    LOW      LOW       LOW       MEDIUM
```

**Critical Risks** (Immediate Action Required):
- Serious financial misconduct (e.g., fraud >$100K)
- Safety issues creating imminent danger
- Sexual harassment or assault
- Data breaches exposing sensitive information
- Regulatory violations with severe penalties
- Serial offenders with pattern of misconduct
- Issues likely to become public imminently

**High Risks** (Urgent Investigation):
- Harassment or discrimination
- Moderate financial misconduct
- Policy violations with legal exposure
- Retaliation concerns
- Second occurrence of similar issue
- Department-wide problems

**Medium Risks** (Standard Investigation):
- Isolated policy violations
- Interpersonal conflicts
- Minor financial irregularities
- Process improvement opportunities
- First-time, lower-impact issues

**Low Risks** (Routine Handling):
- Minor complaints
- Misunderstandings requiring clarification
- Process questions
- Already resolved issues

### 4. Risk Mitigation

**Immediate Actions for High/Critical Risks**:
1. **Contain the Risk**: Stop ongoing harm (suspend subject if appropriate, secure evidence, implement interim controls)
2. **Escalate**: Notify compliance officer, legal counsel, senior leadership immediately
3. **Expedite Investigation**: Assign experienced investigator, allocate resources, set aggressive timeline
4. **Protect Reporter**: Enhanced [anti-retaliation](/compliance/anti-retaliation) monitoring
5. **Communication Plan**: Prepare for potential public disclosure, brief stakeholders

**Investigation-Based Mitigation**:
- Thorough evidence collection
- Expert involvement (forensic accountants, legal counsel, external investigators)
- Comprehensive analysis

**Systemic Mitigation** (for patterns):
- Root cause analysis
- Policy updates
- Enhanced controls
- Department-wide interventions
