# Policy Management

Comprehensive policy lifecycle management for whistleblowing and compliance policies. Create, distribute, track acknowledgments, maintain versions, and ensure organizational alignment with regulatory requirements including [EU Directive](/compliance/eu-directive), [SOX](/compliance/sox), and [GDPR](/compliance/gdpr).

## Why Policy Management Matters

**Legal Requirements**:
- Many jurisdictions require documented whistleblowing policies
- Policies must be communicated to all employees
- Regular review and updates required
- Version control for audit purposes

**Operational Benefits**:
- Clear expectations for employees
- Consistent handling of reports
- Training and reference material
- Evidence of compliance effort
- Risk mitigation through clear guidelines

**Key Policies for Whistleblowing**:
- Whistleblowing policy
- Anti-retaliation policy
- Code of conduct
- Investigation procedures
- Confidentiality policy
- Data retention and privacy policy

## Policy Lifecycle

### 1. Policy Creation

**Whistleblowing Policy Elements**:
