# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Add an essential layer of security to protect your whistleblowing platform with multi-factor authentication.

## Overview

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly strengthens account security by requiring two or more verification methods to access your Disclosurely account. Even if someone obtains your password through phishing, data breach, or guessing, they cannot access your account without the second factor. For organizations handling sensitive whistleblowing data, MFA is essential to protect reporter confidentiality, prevent unauthorized case access, and maintain compliance with security standards like ISO 27001 and SOC 2.

MFA is **mandatory for Organization Administrators** and **strongly recommended for all users** with access to whistleblowing cases. Enabling MFA reduces the risk of account takeover by 99.9% according to industry research, making it one of the most effective security controls available.

## Why MFA Matters for Whistleblowing Platforms

### Protecting Sensitive Data

Whistleblowing platforms contain extraordinarily sensitive information that requires the highest level of protection:

- **Reporter identities**: Unauthorized access could expose whistleblowers to retaliation
- **Investigation evidence**: Confidential documents, financial records, and witness statements
- **Case details**: Sensitive allegations involving executives, harassment, or fraud
- **Secure communications**: Private messages between reporters and investigators
- **Personal data**: Names, contact information, and employment details

A single compromised account could expose this sensitive data, damage trust in your reporting system, create legal liability, and violate regulatory requirements. MFA prevents this by ensuring that stolen passwords alone cannot grant access.

### Common Security Threats MFA Prevents

**Phishing Attacks:**
- Fraudulent emails tricking users into revealing passwords
- Fake login pages that capture credentials
- MFA blocks access even if password is compromised

**Credential Stuffing:**
- Automated attacks using leaked passwords from other breaches
- Many users reuse passwords across multiple sites
- MFA stops these attacks at the authentication stage

**Password Guessing:**
- Brute force attacks trying common passwords
- Social engineering to guess passwords from personal information
- MFA makes password guessing ineffective

**Insider Threats:**
- Former employees attempting to access systems after departure
- Unauthorized colleagues trying to access restricted cases
- MFA limits access to authorized devices and methods

**Session Hijacking:**
- Attackers stealing active session tokens
- Network interception of login sessions
- MFA with device binding prevents session theft

Learn more about overall security controls in the [Security Overview](/security/overview) documentation.

## Supported MFA Methods

### Authenticator Apps (Recommended)

Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) generated by authenticator applications provide the best balance of security and convenience.

**Supported Authenticator Apps:**
- Google Authenticator (iOS, Android)
- Microsoft Authenticator (iOS, Android)
- Authy (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- 1Password (iOS, Android, Desktop, Browser)
- Bitwarden Authenticator (iOS, Android)
- Any TOTP-compatible authenticator

**How It Works:**
1. During setup, scan a QR code with your authenticator app
2. App generates new 6-digit codes every 30 seconds
3. Enter current code when logging in
4. Works offline, no network connection required
5. Codes synchronized via secure time-based algorithm

**Benefits:**
- Works without cellular or internet connection
- More secure than SMS (no SIM swap risk)
- Fast and convenient
- Multiple accounts in one app
- Backup and sync options (app-dependent)

### SMS Verification

Text message codes sent to your mobile phone provide accessible MFA for users without smartphones or authenticator apps.

**How It Works:**
1. Enter your mobile phone number during setup
2. Receive 6-digit code via SMS at login
3. Enter code to complete authentication
4. New code required for each login session

**Considerations:**
- Requires cellular connection or SMS capability
- Vulnerable to SIM swap attacks (rare but possible)
- May have delays in code delivery
- International SMS may have additional costs
- Less secure than authenticator apps but better than password-only

### Email Verification

Email codes provide a fallback MFA option when other methods aren't available.

**How It Works:**
1. Configure backup email address
2. Receive verification code via email at login
3. Enter code to complete authentication
4. Different email than primary account email recommended

**When to Use:**
- Backup method if phone unavailable
- Users without mobile devices
- Temporary access for specific situations
- Not recommended as primary MFA method

### Hardware Security Keys (Enterprise Plan)

Physical USB or NFC security keys provide the highest level of security for Enterprise customers.

**Supported Keys:**
- YubiKey 5 Series
- Google Titan Security Keys
- Feitian ePass FIDO Keys
- Any FIDO2/WebAuthn compatible key

**How It Works:**
1. Insert USB key or tap NFC key
2. Press button to confirm
3. Cryptographic challenge-response authentication
4. Phishing-resistant authentication

**Benefits:**
- Most secure MFA method available
- Phishing resistant (cannot be tricked)
- No codes to enter
- Works offline
- Durable and long-lasting

### Biometric Authentication

Device biometrics like fingerprint and Face ID can be used in conjunction with other MFA methods on supported devices.

**Supported Biometrics:**
- Apple Touch ID and Face ID
- Windows Hello (fingerprint, facial recognition)
- Android fingerprint sensors
- Platform-specific biometric authentication

**How It Works:**
- Stored locally on your device, never transmitted
- Used to unlock authenticator apps or hardware keys
- Provides convenient second-factor on trusted devices
- Combines with other MFA methods for enhanced security

## Setting Up MFA
