# Guide for Case Handlers

Comprehensive guide for case handlers on managing investigations, caseload organization, and daily workflow best practices.

## Case Handler Role Overview

As a Case Handler (also called Case Administrator or Lead Investigator), you serve as the central coordinator for your organization's whistleblowing investigations. You bridge reporters, investigators, reviewers, and administrators—triaging incoming reports, assigning cases to appropriate investigators, monitoring investigation progress, and ensuring compliance with regulatory deadlines. Your role is critical to the effectiveness of your organization's whistleblowing program.

Case Handlers have broad access to view and manage all cases across the organization, enabling you to ensure balanced workload distribution, consistent investigation quality, timely resolution, and compliance with regulations like the EU Whistleblowing Directive. You're the operational backbone of the whistleblowing program, maintaining momentum and accountability throughout the investigation lifecycle.

## Daily Workflow

### Starting Your Day

**Morning Dashboard Review (15-30 minutes):**

1. **Check New Reports**
   - Review reports submitted in last 24 hours
   - Assess urgency and severity
   - Identify reports requiring immediate attention
   - Note any safety or legal concerns
   - Prepare for initial case assignments

2. **Monitor Compliance Deadlines**
   - Check for cases approaching 7-day acknowledgment deadline
   - Review cases nearing 3-month resolution deadline
   - Identify investigations requiring extension approval
   - Flag overdue cases for immediate action
   - Send reminders to investigators as needed

3. **Review Priority Cases**
   - High-severity allegations (fraud, harassment, safety)
   - Cases involving senior executives

## Caseload Management

### Distributing Work Effectively

**Load Balancing Strategies:**

**Monitor Investigator Capacity:**

### Handling Case Escalations

**When to Escalate:**

**To Administrator:**

- Immediate physical danger
- Industry-specific reporting obligations (financial services, healthcare)

**Escalation Process:**
1. Document reason for escalation clearly
2. Prepare summary of allegations and evidence
3. Notify relevant stakeholders promptly
4. Coordinate with administrator on communication
5. Continue case management as directed
6. Document all escalation decisions

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Reporter Not Responding to Questions

**Possible Reasons:**
- Didn't check tracking portal recently
- Fear or hesitation about further involvement
- Don't understand what's being asked
- Lost or forgot tracking ID
- Technical issues accessing portal

**Your Actions:**
1. Send follow-up message with clear, specific questions
2. Extend deadline if reasonable
3. Explain importance of their response to investigation
4. Offer alternative communication methods if appropriate
5. Proceed with investigation using available information
6. Document all communication attempts

### Investigation Taking Too Long

**Identify Cause:**
- Investigator workload too high?
- Waiting for external information?
- Complex case requiring extensive work?
- Investigator needs training or support?
- Case assigned to wrong investigator?

**Your Actions:**
1. Discuss with investigator to understand delays
2. Provide additional resources or support
3. Reassign case if necessary
4. Request timeline extension if justified
5. Break complex case into phases
6. Escalate to administrator if systemic issue
7. Document reasons for delay

### Conflict Between Investigator and Subject

**Warning Signs:**
- Investigator knows subject personally
- Subject is investigator's friend or relative
- Past conflict between them
- Investigator seems biased
- Subject requests different investigator

**Your Actions:**
1. Reassign case immediately to different investigator
2. Document conflict and reassignment rationale
3. Review prior work for bias
4. Consider whether investigation needs to restart
5. Ensure reassigned investigator is truly neutral
6. Monitor new investigation closely

### Multiple Reports About Same Issue

**Coordination Strategy:**
1. Identify that reports relate to same issue/subject
2. Link cases in system for cross-reference
3. Assign to same investigator when possible
4. Consolidate evidence and witness lists
5. Coordinate with each reporter separately
6. Maintain confidentiality of other reporters
7. Document relationship between cases
8. Consider broader systemic investigation
