# Guide for Whistleblowers

Complete guide for whistleblowers on safely reporting misconduct, protecting your identity, and understanding your rights.

## Welcome, Whistleblower

Thank you for your courage in considering reporting misconduct. Speaking up about wrongdoing, unethical behavior, or violations of law and policy is an act of integrity that helps protect your organization, colleagues, and the public. This guide will help you understand the reporting process, your options for maintaining anonymity or confidentiality, and your legal protections against retaliation.

Whistleblowing can feel intimidating, but Disclosurely makes it safe, secure, and straightforward. Whether you're reporting financial fraud, harassment, safety violations, or any other concern, you deserve to be heard without fear of retaliation. This platform provides military-grade encryption, zero-knowledge architecture, and anonymous reporting options to protect your identity while ensuring your concerns are thoroughly investigated.

## Your Reporting Options

### Anonymous vs. Confidential Reporting

You have two primary ways to submit a report, each with different levels of identity protection:

**Anonymous Reporting:**
- **Complete anonymity**: Your identity is never known to anyone
- **No account required**: No registration or login needed
- **Tracking ID access**: Use unique tracking ID to check status and communicate
- **Maximum protection**: Even Disclosurely cannot identify you
- **Best for**: Cases where you fear retaliation or prefer complete privacy

**Confidential Reporting:**
- **Identity known**: Your name is known to authorized investigators only
- **Protected disclosure**: Your identity kept confidential, not shared publicly
- **Easier follow-up**: Direct communication with investigators
- **Identity protection**: Separately encrypted from report content
- **Best for**: Cases where you're comfortable revealing your identity to investigators

Learn more about the differences in the [Report Types](/reporting/report-types) documentation.

## How to Submit Your Report

### Step-by-Step Submission Process

1. **Access the Secure Portal**

   - Access from personal device for maximum anonymity
   - Verify HTTPS connection and correct URL

   - Can't change to confidential later if you choose anonymous

3. **Select Category**
   - Choose the category that best fits your concern
   - Financial misconduct, harassment, safety, etc.
   - Helps route to appropriate investigation team
   - Add details about other categories in description

4. **Provide Details**
   - Who: Names or descriptions of people involved
   - What: Specific actions, behaviors, or violations
   - When: Dates, times, frequency
   - Where: Locations, departments, facilities
   - How: Explain how you know about the misconduct
   - Evidence: Reference documents, witnesses, or proof

5. **Upload Evidence**

6. **Save Your Tracking ID**

   - Store securely (password manager recommended)
   - Cannot be recovered if lost (by design for security)
   - Needed to check status and communicate

### Writing an Effective Report

**Be Specific:**

**Include Evidence:**

**Be Factual:**
- Stick to what you personally witnessed or know

- Don't exaggerate or embellish
- Avoid emotional language
- Focus on the misconduct, not personal grievances

**Consider Timing:**
- Report as soon as possible after discovering misconduct
