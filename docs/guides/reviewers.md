# Guide for Reviewers

Complete guide for reviewers on oversight responsibilities, quality assurance, and investigation review best practices.

## Reviewer Role Overview

As a Reviewer in your organization's whistleblowing program, you provide critical oversight and quality assurance for investigations. This read-only role is typically assigned to compliance officers, audit committee members, legal counsel, or senior management who need visibility into whistleblowing cases without directly conducting investigations. Your oversight ensures investigations are conducted thoroughly, fairly, and in compliance with regulatory requirements and organizational policies.

The Reviewer role balances transparency with confidentiality. You can access assigned cases to monitor investigation quality, verify compliance with procedures, and provide guidance to investigators, but you cannot modify case data or directly participate in investigations. This separation ensures appropriate oversight while maintaining investigative independence and clear accountability for investigation outcomes.

## Understanding Your Access Level

### Read-Only Permissions

Reviewers have **view-only access** to assigned cases, which includes:

**What You Can Access:**
- Complete case details including allegations and evidence
- Investigation timeline and status updates
- Case notes and investigator documentation
- Evidence files and attachments
- Secure message exchanges between investigators and reporters
- Case resolution and outcomes
- Audit trail for the case

**What You Cannot Do:**
- Modify case information or status
- Add case notes or comments
- Send messages to reporters
- Upload evidence or documents
- Assign or reassign cases
- Change case priority or category
- Delete or archive cases

**Why Read-Only Access:**
- Maintains clear accountability (investigators responsible for decisions)
- Prevents accidental modifications to case record
- Ensures investigation independence
- Provides oversight without interference
- Creates clear audit trail of who made what changes

Learn more about roles in the [Team Management](/admin/team-management) documentation.

### Assigned vs. All Cases

**Case Assignment Methods:**

**1. Category-Based Assignment:**
- Automatically assigned all cases in specific categories
- Example: Legal counsel reviews all harassment cases
- Example: CFO reviews all financial misconduct cases
- Ensures subject matter expertise oversight

**2. Individual Case Assignment:**
- Administrator assigns specific high-profile or sensitive cases
- Used for cases requiring specialized oversight
- Escalated cases needing senior review
- Cases with potential legal or regulatory implications

**3. Department-Based Assignment:**
- Assigned cases from specific business units or locations
- Used for decentralized oversight models
- Regional compliance officers review local cases
- Business unit leaders monitor their areas

**Requesting Access:**
If you believe you should have access to a case but don't, contact your organization administrator. All access is logged in the audit trail for accountability.

## Key Reviewer Responsibilities

### Investigation Oversight

**Monitoring Investigation Quality:**

**Thoroughness Review:**

**Procedural Compliance:**
- Are regulatory timelines being met (7-day acknowledgment, 3-month resolution)?
- Is the investigation following organizational procedures?
- Are proper evidence handling protocols observed?
- Is confidentiality being maintained appropriately?
- Are subjects given opportunity to respond?
- Is there appropriate escalation for serious findings?

**Fairness and Impartiality:**
