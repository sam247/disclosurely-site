# Case Resolution

Complete guide to concluding investigations and implementing outcomes appropriately.

## Overview

Case resolution is the critical final phase where investigation findings are translated into actions. Proper resolution ensures:

- **Justice**: Appropriate consequences for misconduct
- **Fairness**: Consistent treatment across cases
- **Learning**: Organizational improvements from findings
- **Closure**: Reporter receives outcome feedback
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements met
- **Prevention**: Systemic issues addressed

## Determining Findings

### Standards of Proof

Choose the appropriate standard for your case:

**Balance of Probabilities (50%+)**
- **Standard**: More likely to have occurred than not
- **Use For**: Most employment matters, policy violations, internal investigations
- **Practical Meaning**: If you had to decide one way or the other, which is more probable?

**Clear and Convincing Evidence (75%+)**
- **Standard**: Highly probable that allegations are true
- **Use For**: Serious misconduct, termination decisions, professional sanctions
- **Practical Meaning**: You have strong confidence in your conclusion

**Beyond Reasonable Doubt (95%+)**
- **Standard**: No reasonable alternative explanation
- **Use For**: Criminal matters (typically not internal investigations)
- **Practical Meaning**: Virtually certain
- **Note**: Usually not appropriate for internal investigations; refer criminal matters to authorities

### Finding Categories

**Substantiated**
- Evidence supports allegation
- Standard of proof met
- Violation occurred as alleged
- Action warranted

**Partially Substantiated**
- Some allegations supported by evidence
- Others not proven
- Mixed findings
- Some action warranted

**Unsubstantiated**
- Insufficient evidence to prove allegation
- Doesn't mean allegation is false
- Can't conclude either way
- Often "he said, she said" situations

**Unfounded/False**
- Evidence disproves allegation
- Allegation demonstrably false
- Consider if false report was intentional
- Rare outcome (most are substantiated or unsubstantiated)

**Inconclusive**
- Conflicting evidence
- Unable to reach conclusion
- Significant doubts remain
- May warrant preventive measures even without finding

### Documenting Findings

**For Each Allegation**:

1. **Restate Allegation Clearly**
   - What specifically was claimed
   - What policy/law allegedly violated
   - Time period involved

2. **Summarize Evidence**
   - [Evidence supporting allegation](/cases/evidence)
   - Evidence contradicting allegation
   - Credibility of sources
   - Corroboration or lack thereof

3. **State Finding**
   - Substantiated, unsubstantiated, etc.
   - Standard of proof applied
   - Level of confidence

4. **Explain Reasoning**
   - Why you reached this conclusion
   - What evidence was most persuasive
   - What doubts considered and why overcome (or not)
   - Alternative explanations considered

**Example**:

```
ALLEGATION 1: Subject submitted fraudulent expense claims by
deliberately keeping amounts just under approval threshold to
avoid review.

EVIDENCE:
Supporting:
- 47 expense claims in Q4 2023, all between £480-£495
- Same restaurant for "client dinners" 3-4x per week
- No client meeting records for dates claimed
- Witness testimony that subject ate alone
- Subject unable to name clients allegedly present

Contradicting:
- Subject claims clients prefer not to be named in records
- No explicit policy against frequent dining expenses
- Receipts appear legitimate

FINDING: Substantiated (clear and convincing evidence)

REASONING: The pattern of 47 expenses all just below the £500
approval threshold is statistically improbable absent deliberate
manipulation. Subject's inability to name even one client present
at these dinners, combined with witness observations of subject
dining alone, satisfies the clear and convincing standard. While
receipts are genuine, this proves expenses were incurred but not
that they were for legitimate business purposes as claimed.
```
