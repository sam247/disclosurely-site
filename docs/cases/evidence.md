# Case Notes and Evidence

Comprehensive guide to documenting investigations and managing evidence properly.

## Overview

Thorough documentation and evidence management are critical for:

- **Defensible investigations**: Stand up to legal scrutiny
- **Audit compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements
- **Knowledge retention**: Maintain institutional memory
- **Quality assurance**: Enable peer review
- **Accountability**: Demonstrate diligence
- **Consistency**: Support fair treatment across cases

## Case Notes

### What Are Case Notes?

Internal documentation of investigation activities, not visible to reporters. Use case notes to create a chronological record of:

- Investigation actions taken
- Decisions made and reasoning
- Conversations and interviews
- Observations and insights
- Questions and concerns
- Next steps planned

### When to Add Notes

**After Every Investigation Activity**:
- Reviewing new report
- Interviewing witness
- Collecting evidence
- Making key decision
- Communicating with reporter
- Receiving new information
- Changing investigation direction
- Consulting with colleagues
- Taking any significant action

**Best Practice**: Document immediately while details fresh. Don't rely on memory.

### Writing Effective Case Notes

**Include These Elements**:

1. **Date and Time**
   - Automatically timestamped
   - Helps establish timeline
   - Critical for audit trail

2. **What You Did**
   - Not just what you found, but what action you took
   - "Interviewed John Smith" not just "John said..."
   - "Reviewed emails from March-April" not just "Found evidence"

3. **What You Learned**
   - Key information obtained
   - Important quotes (verbatim)
   - Facts discovered
   - Patterns observed

4. **What It Means**
   - How information relates to allegations
   - Whether it supports or contradicts claims
   - Significance to investigation

5. **What You'll Do Next**
   - Follow-up actions needed
   - Additional interviews required
   - Documents to request
   - Questions remaining

**Example - Good Case Note**:

```
2024-03-15 14:30

Interviewed Jane Doe (Senior Accountant, Finance Dept) regarding
allegation of expense fraud by reported subject.

Jane confirmed she noticed unusual expense patterns in Q4 2023:
- Multiple expenses just under £500 approval threshold
- Receipts that "looked odd" - her words
- Same restaurant appearing 3-4 times per week

She said: "I flagged it to my manager in December but nothing
happened. I assumed they dealt with it."

Jane provided:
- Spreadsheet of flagged expenses (uploaded to evidence)
- Email to her manager dated Dec 12, 2023 (uploaded)
- Names of 2 colleagues who had similar concerns

Jane credible and specific. Her evidence corroborates reporter's
allegations about systematic expense fraud.

Next steps:
- Interview Jane's manager about why not escalated
- Review all subject's Q4 2023 expenses
- Interview 2 colleagues Jane mentioned
- Request restaurant receipts for forensic review
```

**Example - Poor Case Note**:

```
Talked to Jane. She said expenses were weird. Got some files.
```

### Note Categories and Tags

**Organize notes with tags**:

- **Interview Notes**: Witness interviews conducted
- **Evidence**: Documents and files collected
- **Analysis**: Your thinking and conclusions
- **Communication**: Messages with reporter/subject via [secure messaging](/reporting/secure-messaging)
- **Administrative**: [Status changes](/cases/status), assignments
- **Legal**: Consultations with legal counsel
- **External**: Third party involvement
- **Decision**: Key choices and reasoning

**Benefits**:
- Find notes quickly
- Filter by note type
- Generate reports
- Support audit review

### Private vs. Shared Notes

**Private Notes**:
- Visible only to you
- Use for work-in-progress thoughts
- Preliminary opinions
- Questions for yourself
- Personal reminders

**Shared Notes**:
- Visible to team members on case
- Use for factual information
- Evidence collected
- Actions taken
- Coordination with team

**Upgrade Private to Shared**:
- When thought becomes conclusion
- When team needs to see
- When audit trail required
- Cannot downgrade shared notes (audit integrity)

- Certificate of destruction
- Approved by compliance officer

## Best Practices

### Document Contemporaneously

**Why**:
- Memory fades quickly
- Details lost over time
- Credibility questioned if delayed
- Legal requirement in some jurisdictions

**Do**:
- Write notes immediately after activities
- Same day minimum
- While impressions fresh
- Before next task

**Don't**:
- Batch notes at end of week
- Rely on memory days later
- Backdate notes
- Create notes out of sequence

### Be Objective and Factual

**Do**:
- State facts observed
- Quote exact words
- Note sources
- Distinguish fact from opinion
- Show reasoning

**Don't**:
- Insert personal biases
- Make assumptions
- Draw premature conclusions
- Use inflammatory language
- Speculate without basis

**Example - Objective**:
"Subject's expense submissions show 47 claims for dinner at same restaurant over 3-month period. Each claim between £480-£495. Company policy requires approval for expenses over £500."

**Example - Subjective**:
"Subject clearly knew he was manipulating the system by keeping expenses just under the limit. Obviously fraudulent."

### Protect Confidentiality

**In Notes**:
- Use role instead of names where possible
- "Reporter" not actual name
- "Subject" not actual name
- Note if identity must be shared (investigation requires)

**In Evidence**:
- Redact unnecessary personal data
- Remove unrelated names
- Protect bystander privacy
- Comply with GDPR/privacy laws

**Access Control**:
- Limit evidence access to need-to-know
- Log all evidence views
- Restrict downloads
- Watermark sensitive documents

### Maintain Integrity

**Never**:
- Alter original evidence
- Delete unfavorable information
- Hide evidence that contradicts theory
- Create false documentation
- Backdate or forward-date notes
- Share evidence inappropriately

**Always**:
- Preserve everything
- Document all evidence (even if not using)
- Maintain chronological record
- Create audit trail
- Secure evidence
- Follow procedures

### Use Evidence Checklist

✅ Evidence index complete
✅ All evidence linked to allegations
✅ Chain of custody documented
✅ Sources noted for all evidence
✅ Privileged evidence marked
